    "text": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) has the potential to completely transform healthcare delivery. AI-enhanced computer vision technology can revolutionize medical image analysis, disease detection, patient monitoring, surgical assistance, drug discovery acceleration, and the development of personalized treatment plans. The adoption of AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare promises numerous benefits, including improved diagnostic accuracy, reduced costs, personalized care, enhanced patient outcomes, and accelerated drug discovery processes. However, the implementation of these technologies also presents challenges, such as concerns regarding data privacy, bias, and legal issues. This chapter explores various applications of computer vision in healthcare, encompassing medical image analysis, disease diagnosis, movement analysis, surgical support, behavioral analysis, and drug discovery. Additionally, the chapter addresses the challenges associated with integrating computer vision into healthcare systems, including privacy concerns, bias mitigation, legal considerations, accessibility issues, and the complexity of biological systems. Despite these challenges, AI-assisted computer vision holds great promise for revolutionizing healthcare delivery by facilitating faster and more accurate diagnoses, improving patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. It is essential to address these challenges responsibly to ensure the ethical and equitable deployment of these technologies.",
