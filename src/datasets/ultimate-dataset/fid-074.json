    "text": "Directly affected by climatic changes, the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems. To maintain maximum potential energy conversion at nominal conditions, the controller operates the pumping system. Fuzzy logic intelligent controllers are notably applicable in engineering and applied science, successfully suitable. The paper aims to present an experimental approach in implementing fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with a boost converter based on Arduino Mega micro-controller. This aims to maximize energy production in various weather conditions, particularly applied to small-scale pumping systems for water and chemical fluid analyses in isolated areas. The system is powered by a 20 (W) solar photovoltaic (PV) panel. Real-time MATLAB/Simulink fuzzy logic method controlling and monitoring MPPT application is presented in this paper. It utilizes a low-cost Arduino Mega micro-controller combined with (LV25, LP55) sensors controlling a boost converter interconnected with a solar panel and plastic pump.",
