    "text": "The upcoming sustainability of the global automotive sector will be significantly impacted by the fourth industrial revolution and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). The predicted new norm is set to be driven by fresh industry norms, including an increasingly autonomous self-driving technology, revised safety protocols, more intricate insurance regulations, adaptive societal responses to tech changes, city infrastructure needs with a digital gap, and disruptive business innovations based on strategic input supply alliances with open-source AI. In this segment, the crucial aspects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are examined using AI progressions in radar and laser tech, commercial risk factors, self-driving consumer patterns, urban infrastructure restraints, and social adaptations to novel tech. The future course of the AV sector is anticipated to be a blend of commercial, social, risk, infrastructure, and regulatory dynamics with diverse impacts on industry stakeholders. This investigation forecasts that the most probable sustainable scenario for the AV sector is driven by: (1) AI's pulsed laser LiDAR with a suitable loop frequency and GPS bi-directional cloud technology demand, (2) consolidated insurance as opposed to individual responsibility, (3) intelligent urban infrastructure with a projected sharp digital disparity across transportation regions leading to increased regional disparity, and (4) clients who highly favor a human controlled semi-autonomous vehicle over total machine autonomy.",
