    "text": "In recent years, the relentless advancement of science and technology, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, has prompted a paradigm shift in the education system towards personalized content delivery. Unlike traditional approaches, which often employ a one-size-fits-all teaching model, personalized education systems leverage machine learning algorithms to tailor learning experiences to individual students' unique needs, preferences, and learning styles. By analyzing students' learning histories, interests, and abilities, these systems can generate customized learning materials and recommendations, ultimately enhancing learning outcomes. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms enable real-time performance feedback and learning plan adjustments based on student responses, fostering a dynamic and personalized learning environment. This personalized approach to education holds promise across various domains, including language learning, mathematics, and science. However, the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in this context hinges on the advancement of numerical optimization algorithms. Thus, this paper undertakes a comprehensive examination of existing machine learning algorithms optimized for personalized education recommendation systems, elucidating the algorithm optimization process in detail.",
