    "text": "Fuzzy inference systems (FISs) have been a subject of extensive study over the years, yet their application to high-dimensional problems remains a formidable challenge. Among the commonly utilized T-norms for computing firing strengths, the product and minimum operators stand out, with the former being favored due to its differentiability. However, when confronted with high-dimensional problems, the product T-norm encounters the issue of numeric underflow. In this study, our primary objective is to tackle this challenge associated with T-norms in the design of high-dimensional FISs (HDFISs). Specifically, we introduce HDFIS-prod, a novel HDFIS framework that effectively mitigates the numeric underflow problem inherent in the product T-norm. The key innovation lies in the introduction of an adaptive dimension-dependent membership function (DMF), which enables HDFIS-prod to navigate high-dimensional spaces seamlessly. Additionally, for the minimum T-norm, empirical observations have inspired the development of a mechanism tailored to address super high-dimensional problems, resulting in the creation of another HDFIS dubbed HDFIS-min. Both HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min undergo rigorous testing across 18 datasets featuring varying feature dimensions ranging from 1024 to 120450. The simulation outcomes underscore the competitive performance of both frameworks in handling high-dimensional datasets effectively.",
