    "text": "Achieving precise trajectory tracking under real-world conditions is often deemed unattainable, despite being a common assumption in motion planning algorithm development. This study introduces a robust motion planning and control framework aimed at managing tracking inaccuracies by harmonizing the motion planning layer with the controller. The strategy involves partitioning the motion space into safe and hazardous zones, where the size of movement constraints is tailored to the extent of tracking error, thereby constructing a repulsive potential field. By integrating global exploration with a novel waypoint filtering technique, a collision-free set of waypoints is derived. The resultant trajectory is refined through optimization techniques to minimize trajectory acceleration. Subsequently, an anti-collision adjustment mechanism is implemented to ensure safety. Employing invertible transformation and adaptive compensation techniques confines transient tracking errors within predefined boundaries, even in the presence of actuator faults. By accounting for tracking errors during the planning phase and implementing margining, the coordination between planning and control levels ensures safety and reliability amidst tracking inaccuracies and faults. Simulation and experimental findings substantiate the efficacy and advantages of the proposed motion planning and control methodology.",
