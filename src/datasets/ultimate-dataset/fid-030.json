    "text": "The increasing population results in a larger consumer base, creating more demand and strain on resources to meet their needs. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging technology to revolutionize the supermarket experience. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), we aim to automate supermarket operations for enhanced efficiency. Upon entering the store, customers scan their unique QR code via a dedicated app, registering their presence. Smart shopping carts and baskets equipped with sensors detect products being added or removed. Shelves are fitted with pressure sensors to monitor product movement, which only open upon detecting a customer's shopping card. At checkout, customers simply swipe their card again, and payment is automatically deducted from their account, with a receipt provided. Our goal is to offer this innovative technology to supermarket chains domestically and internationally, enabling them to streamline operations with a minimal initial investment.",
