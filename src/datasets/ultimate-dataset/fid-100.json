    "text": "The metaverse has emerged as an intriguing new concept in human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual collaboration. This paper presents an extensive review of the metaverse, aiming to fill a gap in the existing literature by providing a survey that examines the essence of the metaverse and its fundamental components from a human-centered perspective. Initially, we compile a definition of the metaverse based on existing literature and outline its key capabilities. Subsequently, we introduce a comprehensive framework that covers the metaverse's essence, underlying technologies, and input/output mechanisms that facilitate multi-sensory HCI, along with its applications across various domains. Each component within this framework is thoroughly explored, offering insights into the metaverse's nature and the current state of readiness of associated technologies. Drawing on this thorough analysis, we identify significant challenges and propose promising avenues for further research and exploration. By elucidating the vision for the metaverse and delineating the essential building blocks needed for its realization, this review offers critical insights and serves as a valuable resource for developers and researchers striving to advance this groundbreaking new medium.",
