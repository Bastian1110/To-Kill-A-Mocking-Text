    "text": "To comprehend its functions in AV systems, we must first examine AI's development and history. Over the past century, various nations have conducted extensive research, fueling the automation of road vehicles. The development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is currently pursued by all significant motor manufacturers worldwide. Undoubtedly, the widespread use of autonomous cars is more imminent than we realize, given the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The issues mentioned above, which also impede economic development, can be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter, reducing their reliance on humans. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road are increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents, resulting from the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI has emerged as a crucial component. This development of AI is being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources.",
