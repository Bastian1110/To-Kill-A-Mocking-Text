    "text": "Recent advancements in technology have empowered computers to identify and categorize facial expressions, thus discerning a personâ€™s emotional state in images or videos. Known as 'Facial Expression Recognition (FER)', this process has emerged as a leading research area in computer vision. Deep FER systems have recently focused on overcoming two significant challenges: overfitting due to limited training data and expression-unrelated variations like illumination, head pose, image resolution, and identity bias. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of deep FER, covering algorithms and datasets that shed light on these challenges. It begins with a detailed timeline showcasing the evolution of methods and datasets in deep FER, illustrating their progression and development. Subsequently, the paper reviews FER methods, from traditional approaches using handcrafted features like SVM and HOG to deep learning methods. Benchmark datasets, categorized into controlled (lab) and uncontrolled (in the wild) environments, are introduced for evaluating FER methods, along with a comparison of different FER models. The paper also discusses existing deep neural networks and training strategies designed for FER, focusing on both static images and dynamic sequences. Finally, it outlines remaining challenges and opportunities in FER, as well as future directions for robust deep FER systems.",
