    "text": "This paper proposes a personalized recommendation model for educational video game resources leveraging knowledge graphs to enhance teaching outcomes. Recognizing that games can serve as valuable teaching tools, the model aims to improve the quality of recommendations by considering user preferences and temporal dynamics.The model begins by extracting features from both users and items, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their characteristics. To capture the temporal nature of user preferences, a hidden Markov model is introduced, which is optimized to account for both long-term and short-term preferences. This optimization enables the model to effectively mine users' potential preferences over time. Experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving a high hit rate index value of 0.7989 and a normalized cumulative gain value of 0.6045. Moreover, over 89% of users express satisfaction with the recommendations generated by the model. Notably, the model demonstrates efficiency with a running time of 0.2863 seconds. Overall, the constructed recommendation model offers efficient and high-quality recommendations for educational video game resources, enhancing users' online learning experiences by providing personalized and relevant recommendations.",
