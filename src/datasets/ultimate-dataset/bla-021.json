    "text": "This paper presents a study that employs artificial intelligence (AI) to utilize computer vision algorithms for detecting human emotions in video content during user interactions with various visual stimuli. The research seeks to develop software capable of emotion detection by harnessing AI algorithms and image processing pipelines to identify users' facial expressions. The process involves evaluating users through images and implementing computer vision algorithms consistent with psychological theories that define emotions and their recognizable features. The study demonstrates the feasibility of emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and software development and training based on facial expressions. The results showcase successful emotion identification; however, there is a need for further training to improve precision in contexts with more diverse images and additional algorithms to distinguish closely related emotional patterns. The discussion and conclusions underscore the potential of AI and computer vision algorithms in emotion detection, offering insights into software development, ongoing training, and the evolving landscape of emotion recognition technology. Further training is required for contexts with more diverse images, along with additional algorithms capable of effectively distinguishing between facial expressions depicting closely related emotional patterns, thereby enhancing certainty and accuracy.",
