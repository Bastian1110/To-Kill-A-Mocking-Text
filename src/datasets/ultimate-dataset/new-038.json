    "text": "The realm of connected autonomous vehicles offers vast potential, with automation advancements driven by the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Early breakthroughs in engineering, electronics, and other fields have catalyzed AI progress. Various technologies are being explored for use in autonomous vehicles, making significant strides in traffic optimization and reducing accidents. Vehicle autonomy research encompasses two main development avenues: high-level system integrations like new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, and the continuous enhancement of subsystems such as sensors and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System has proven effective in addressing real-world challenges encountered in vehicle autonomy. Situational intelligence, involving extensive data collection, plays a crucial role in creating detailed city maps, conducting land surveys, and ensuring road quality. The transport's infotainment system incorporates features like driver gesture recognition, language translation, and environmental perception facilitated by cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), and object localization within the environment. This chapter explores the historical evolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs), emerging research areas in AI technology for AVs, state-of-the-art datasets utilized in AV research, and various Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms integral to AV system functionality, concluding with a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in AVs.",
