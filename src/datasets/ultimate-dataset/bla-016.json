    "text": "The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart home automation, and other domains has garnered significant attention in recent times. However, the implementation of AI technology necessitates robust computer performance and grapples with challenges pertaining to network security, data analysis, and human-computer interaction. While embedded systems have demonstrated notable success in practical applications, their progress has been hindered by issues such as low overall development efficiency and unstable system performance. In this study, an EP Vision System (VS) was developed based on AI technology. This platform integrates embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to enable intelligent robot interaction and target detection functionalities. Evaluation results revealed that, under similar conditions, both students and experts expressed substantially higher positive evaluations for System X, with 83.5% and 90% respectively, compared to System Y, which garnered only 19% and 4% positive evaluations. Conversely, System Y received predominantly negative evaluations, accounting for 81% and 96% from students and experts respectively. This disparity underscores the efficacy of System X in meeting real-world application requirements and enhancing system recognition efficiency to a significant extent, thereby highlighting the beneficial relationship between AI technology and EP VS.",
