    "text": "The future viability of the global automotive sector will be significantly impacted by the fourth industrial revolution and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). The anticipated new normal is forecasted to be shaped by emerging industry benchmarks, such as an increasingly autonomous self-driving technology, revised safety protocols, intricate insurance regulations, adaptive societal responses to technological advancements, urban infrastructure demands with a digital divide, and revolutionary business strategies centered on collaborative input supply partnerships integrating open-source AI. This section explores the critical elements of autonomous vehicles (AVs) through AI advancements in radar and laser technologies, business risk factors, consumer behavior in self-driving vehicles, urban infrastructure limitations, and societal adjustments to new technologies. The future trajectory of the AV sector is envisaged as an intricate interplay between business, societal, risk, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks, each with distinct implications for industry stakeholders. This analysis posits that the most feasible sustainable scenario for the AV sector involves: (1) AI-driven pulsed laser LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems with a requisite loop frequency and bi-directional cloud GPS technology, (2) collective insurance arrangements as opposed to individual liability coverage, (3) intelligent urban infrastructure characterized by a pronounced digital disparity across transportation zones resulting in heightened regional inequalities, and (4) consumer preferences leaning towards human-operated semi-autonomous vehicles over fully autonomous models.",
