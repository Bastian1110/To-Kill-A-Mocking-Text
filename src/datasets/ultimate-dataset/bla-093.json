    "text": "This review delves into the contentious topic of whether the integration of exergames into physical education (PE) courses yields significant improvements in student performance. It seeks to elucidate the enhancing effect of exergames on PE learning and delineate the conditions conducive to maximizing this effect. Employing the PICOS method, two researchers independently scoured various databases including ProQuest, EBSCO, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP. They meticulously evaluated the quality of literature using the Cochrane system evaluation manual and conducted a meta-analysis of the selected studies. A total of 16 randomized controlled trials, encompassing 2962 subjects, were scrutinized in this study. The meta-analysis unequivocally revealed that exergames exerted a positive influence on student performance in PE learning (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27–0.63, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis elucidated that optimal outcomes were achieved when exergames were introduced in small kindergarten classes and sustained for 1–2 months. By amalgamating empirical evidence from diverse sources, this review underscores the efficacy of exergames as a pedagogical tool in enhancing student performance in PE learning. It offers valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of exergame integration, thereby informing educators and policymakers on strategies to optimize the use of exergames in PE curricula.",
