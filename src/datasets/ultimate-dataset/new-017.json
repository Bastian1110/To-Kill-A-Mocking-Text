    "text": "With the abundant on-board resources in smart vehicles, they have become major candidates for providing ubiquitous services, including public sensing. One of the challenges facing such ubiquitous utilization is the recruitment of the participating vehicles. In this paper, we present the reputation-aware, trajectory-based recruitment (RTR) framework that handles recruitment of vehicles for public sensing. The framework considers the spatiotemporal availability of participants along with their reputation to select vehicles that achieve desired coverage of an area of interest within a budget cap. The framework consists of a reputation assessment scheme, a pricing model, and a selection scheme collaborating for a main recruitment objective; maximizing coverage with minimum cost. We propose greedy heuristic solutions targeting the selection problem in real-time. The RTR framework generalizes the basic selection problem to handle some practical scenarios, including departing vehicles and varying redundancy requirements. We also propose a reputation assessment scheme and a pricing model as parts of the framework. Extensive performance evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted and the evaluation shows that the proposed greedy heuristics are able to achieve results close to previously obtained optimal benchmarks under different scenarios, and that the framework succeeds in achieving high levels of coverage even when vehicles do not stick to their announced trajectories.",
