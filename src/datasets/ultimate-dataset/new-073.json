    "text": "The usability assessment is a highly complex process given the variety of criteria to consider and it manifests imprecision, understood as the lack of concretion about the values to be used, synonymous with ambiguity. The usability evaluation method proposed in this work incorporates elements of Soft Computing such as fuzzy logic and fuzzy linguistic modeling. Furthermore, the use of fuzzy cognitive maps allows adding the interrelation between criteria and therefore to obtain a real global index of usability. A mobile app was developed to evaluate the usability of mobile applications based on this proposal. The application of this proposal in a real-world environment shows that it is an operative solution, reliable, precise and of easy interpretation for its use in the industry.",
