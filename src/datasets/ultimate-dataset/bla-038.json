    "text": "The advent of connected autonomous vehicles presents a myriad of possibilities, with automation progressing due to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitating artificial intelligence (AI). Early developments in engineering, electronics, and various other domains have spurred AI innovation. Numerous technologies are proposed for use in autonomous vehicles, with significant contributions to traffic optimization and reduction of accidents. Two main avenues of development are observed in the study of vehicle autonomy: high-level system integrations such as new-energy vehicles and intelligent transportation systems, and the refinement of subsystems like sensors and information processing systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System demonstrates capabilities that align with real-world challenges in vehicle autonomy. Situational awareness, which involves extensive data collection, is crucial for creating high-definition city maps, conducting land surveys, and ensuring road quality. The transport's infotainment system encompasses features like driver gesture recognition, language translation, and environmental perception aided by cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), and object localization within the environment. This chapter delves into the historical background of autonomous vehicles (AVs), emerging research domains in AI technology for AVs, cutting-edge datasets used in AV research, and various Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) algorithms that form the backbone of AV functionality, concluding with a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in AVs.",
