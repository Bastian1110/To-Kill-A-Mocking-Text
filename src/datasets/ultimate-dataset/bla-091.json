    "text": "This paper introduces a novel game engine, termed GAGI, designed to serve as an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) experimentation platform within the realm of video games, a topic that has garnered increasing attention from the research and academic communities in recent years. AGI experimentation platforms enable the analysis and exploration of various AI agents' behaviors in a visual context. GAGI, functioning as a game engine, enables the creation and development of both 2D and 3D video games using the C++ programming language. Additionally, GAGI offers a unique environment for simulating and studying AI agents within these created games. Users have the capability to deploy multiple AI agents and interact with them in real-time, thereby enhancing comprehension of their interactions and behaviors. The paper compares the features of GAGI with other widely-used game engines in both the video game industry and the research community, highlighting its advantages in terms of design capability and AI support. Furthermore, GAGI facilitates the reproduction of experiments, thus offering numerous possibilities for the research community to conduct and validate their findings. Overall, GAGI presents a promising platform for exploring AGI within the context of video games, providing researchers with valuable tools for experimentation and analysis in this evolving field.",
