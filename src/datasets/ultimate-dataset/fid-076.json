    "text": "This article explores the complexities of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems facing infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To tackle these challenges, we harness the capabilities of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and implement adaptive techniques to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters within robotic dynamics. Throughout the investigation, issues of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance persist due to limitations in distance and visual fields. To effectively address constrained range obstacles, we introduce a general barrier function and prescribed performance methodology. Additionally, to minimize the frequency of controller executions and mitigate the impact of infinite actuator failures, robots synchronize with their leader during actuator faults using reduced network communication resources while maintaining uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory set by the leader. Employing dynamic surface technology, we propose a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy, ensuring semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) signals. Ultimately, we showcase the practical viability of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.",
