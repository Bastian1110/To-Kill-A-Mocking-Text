    "text": "Ensuring precise trajectory tracking presents challenges in real-world scenarios, often overlooked despite its significance in motion planning algorithm development. This study introduces a robust motion planning and control framework aimed at mitigating tracking inaccuracies by integrating the motion planning layer with the controller. The approach involves partitioning the motion space into safe and risky regions based on the magnitude of tracking errors to establish a repulsive potential field, thus facilitating collision-free trajectory planning. By employing a combination of global search and a novel waypoint set filtering method, a collision-free set of waypoints is generated. An optimization-based approach is then utilized to refine the planned trajectory, minimizing deviations from the reference trajectory's acceleration. Subsequent modification of the trajectory ensures safety through anti-collision measures. The integration of invertible transformation and adaptive compensation mechanisms effectively confines transient trajectory tracking errors within predefined bounds, even in the presence of actuator faults. By incorporating tracking error considerations at the planning stage, the coordination between planning and control levels ensures safety and reliability under conditions of inaccurate tracking and actuator faults. Simulation and experimental findings validate the efficacy and benefits of the proposed motion planning and control methodology.",
