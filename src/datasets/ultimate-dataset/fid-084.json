    "text": "Smart cities epitomize the fusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban management, aiming to enhance the quality of life for urban residents. Within this framework, recommender systems, which offer personalized suggestions to city residents, have emerged as pivotal contributors to this fusion. Their effective deployment across various urban domains and their capacity to process vast amounts of urban-generated data have cemented their position as indispensable technologies in urban planning evolution. Our methodology involved a thorough examination of the Web of Science database, yielding 130 relevant articles, which were subsequently filtered to 86. The initial phase comprised a bibliometric analysis, leveraging the SciMAT tool to explore structural aspects. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 statement. The outcomes delineated the diverse mechanisms through which recommendations are filtered across domains like tourism, health, mobility, and transportation. This research stands as a notable milestone with the potential to catalyze the advancement and efficacy of smart cities, laying a robust foundation for future endeavors in this dynamic realm.",
