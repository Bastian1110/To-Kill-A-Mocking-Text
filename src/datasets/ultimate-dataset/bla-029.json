    "text": "Face recognition plays a pivotal role across various domains, spanning from security and surveillance to authentication. With the prevalence of CCTV cameras in households, ensuring safety and monitoring visitors has become commonplace. However, in highly secure environments where unauthorized access is strictly prohibited, there arises a need for advanced systems capable of identifying intruders in real-time. This paper presents a system designed to recognize intruders through surveillance cameras using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The proposed system leverages HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification algorithms to effectively identify faces captured in video streams. The primary objective of this system is to differentiate between authorized personnel and intruders based on facial recognition Implemented successfully, the system processes video inputs in real-time, extracting HOG features from facial images and employing SVM for classification. Through rigorous training, the machine learns to distinguish between individuals affiliated with the organization and unauthorized intruders By harnessing the capabilities of ML and AI algorithms, this system offers enhanced security measures, enabling prompt detection and response to potential security breaches. It empowers organizations and homeowners alike to proactively safeguard their premises and assets, mitigating security risks effectively.",
