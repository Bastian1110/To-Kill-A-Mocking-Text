    "text": "The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have prompted discussions on the potential emergence of theory of mind (ToM) in artificial intelligence (AI). LLMs can attribute beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions with increasing accuracy, relying on recognizing linguistic patterns in datasets rather than human-like empathy. This raises questions about LLMs' ability to empathize and consider individual rights to exceptions, such as assessing character and predicting behavior with sensitivity to individuality. Can LLMs accommodate an individual's claim of uniqueness based on internal mental states, or are they limited to comparing cases based on similarities? We argue that empathy is crucial for honoring exceptions, a distinct value from predictive accuracy where LLMs excel. This discussion delves into the intrinsic and practical value of empathy in considering exceptional cases, suggesting avenues for further investigation.",
