    "text": "The landscape of network news plays a crucial role in providing social information to netizens. However, the vast amount of news data often poses challenges for netizens in accessing key insights. Named Entity Recognition (NER) technology, operating within an artificial intelligence (AI) framework, offers a solution by efficiently classifying essential information such as locations, dates, and other entities within textual data. This article presents an innovative approach that combines NER with deep learning technology, introducing an automatic annotation method for Chinese entity triggers and a high-accuracy NER model requiring minimal training data. The methodology involves training sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, utilizing these vectors to enhance subsequent sequence annotation models. Moreover, the approach effectively identifies neologisms in web news using entity labels, thus enhancing sentiment analysis capabilities. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of the proposed model over traditional models, achieving higher accuracy with a reduced training data set. Additionally, the model exhibits faster convergence speed and improved accuracy, as evidenced by the loss function curve analysis. Notably, the model achieves an impressive average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection, marking a significant advancement in sentiment analysis within the context of network news.",
