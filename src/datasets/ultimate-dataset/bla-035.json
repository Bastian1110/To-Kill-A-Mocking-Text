    "text": "Over recent decades, the proliferation of vehicles on roadways has been on a steady incline, spurred by escalating urban mobility needs and modern logistics demands. Among the myriad adverse consequences of this surge in vehicular presence, which also pose barriers to economic progress, are heightened traffic congestion and increased incidents of traffic accidents. Addressing these challenges hinges significantly on enhancing vehicle intelligence, thereby diminishing reliance on human input. Nations worldwide have dedicated substantial resources over the past century to research endeavors aimed at automating road vehicles. Presently, major automotive manufacturers globally are actively engaged in advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. The impending ubiquity of autonomous cars is accelerated by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). AI assumes a pivotal role in enabling AVs to perceive their surroundings and execute real-time decisions effectively. This reliance on AI is propelled by the proliferation of big data generated by myriad sensing devices and bolstered by state-of-the-art computing capabilities. A comprehensive understanding of AI's evolution and historical trajectory is imperative for grasping its integration within AV systems and functionalities.",
