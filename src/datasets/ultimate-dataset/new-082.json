    "text": "In todayâ€™s personalized business environment, or-ganizations are providing bulk of information regarding their products and services. Recommender system has various accom-plishment on exploiting auxiliary information in matrix factor-ization. To handle data sparsity problem most recommender systems utilized deep learning techniques for in-depth analysis of item content to generate more accurate recommendations. However, these systems still have a research gap on how to handle user reviews effectively. Reviews that were written by users contain a large amount of information that can be utilized for more accurate predictions. This paper proposes a Hybrid Model to address the sparsity problem, convolutional neural network and topic modeling for recommender system, which extract the contextual features of both items and users by utilizing Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with Topic Modeling (Lda2vec) technique to generate latent factors of user and item. Topic Modeling is used to capture important topics from side information and deep learning is used to provide contextual information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the research, an extensive experimental sets were performed on four public datasets (Amazon Instant Video, Kindle store, Health and Personal Care, Automotive). Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed the other state of the art approaches.",
