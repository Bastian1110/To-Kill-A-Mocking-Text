    "text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of science, a harmonious interplay between Artificial Intelligence and neuroscience has emerged, marked by profound implications for understanding the human brain and devising interventions for neurological conditions. Artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in unraveling the intricate neural processes that underpin brain functions and cognitive mechanisms. Recent inquiries have delved into the intricate relationship between neural dynamics and individual happiness, presenting a fascinating avenue for exploration. This study embarks on an evaluation journey, seeking to illuminate the symbiotic relationship between neuroscience and happiness through the lens of Artificial Intelligence advancements. Employing a bibliometric analysis encompassing articles from the Scopus database spanning the decade from 2013 to 2023, and leveraging the analytical power of VOSviewer, the study delves into the wealth of scholarly discourse. With a corpus of 603 articles, the analysis unveils the geographical distribution of scientific productivity, with significant contributions hailing from prominent research hubs like the United States, United Kingdom, and China. Through Co-occurrence - Author Keywords analysis, three thematic clusters emerge, delineating the interconnected realms of AI-driven happiness prediction, the integration of AI tools in neuroscience exploration, and the intersection of neuroscience with psychological inquiries. This study celebrates the remarkable strides in neuroscience, particularly in deciphering complex mental processes like emotions and consciousness, and underscores the transformative potential of AI in augmenting our understanding of human well-being and happiness.",
