    "text": "In international relations scholarship, there has been a longstanding emphasis on the influence of popular culture on public perceptions and political landscapes. In this article, we delve into this phenomenon within the realm of military-themed video games, particularly examining their portrayal of weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). These games often present AI weapons as both formidable adversaries, posing existential threats in narratives, and as easily defeatable targets for human protagonists during gameplay. These conflicting representations distort the dynamics of human-machine interaction, diverging from real-world scenarios. While video games empower players with heightened agency to conquer AI weapons for entertainment, this contradicts the intended function of such weapons, which is to diminish human agency on actual battlefields. Drawing on the Actor-Network Theory concept of translation, we elucidate how these distorted depictions of AI weapons arise from complex interactions between diverse human and non-human elements, driven by the imperative to make video games commercially viable and profitable. This echoes existing game studies research, urging scholars in international relations to pay closer attention to the commercial and recreational aspects of video games, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of popular culture's limited capacity to influence public perceptions and political realities.",
