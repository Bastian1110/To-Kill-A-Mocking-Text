    "text": "Utilizing fuzzy logic principles, the quantification of usability expectations for an m-commerce mobile application becomes a systematic process for evaluating its usability. The evaluation centers on discerning user experiences, aligning with their preferences and expectations. Fuzzy logic stands out as the prime method for this quantification endeavor. By considering user needs, preferences, and expectations, the fuzzy logic-based quantification method offers insights into the user-application interaction, meeting user expectations, and overall satisfaction levels. This approach facilitates pinpointing areas for enhancement, empowering developers to enact necessary modifications for an enhanced user experience. Through the establishment of a usability metric framework, this research endeavors to assess the overall usability quality of m-commerce mobile applications employing fuzzy logic. The framework, grounded in the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology, aims to offer a structured approach to design metrics for evaluating the qualitative aspects of mobile applications. Tested within an m-commerce context, the framework furnishes a set of quantifiable criteria to evaluate m-commerce mobile applications against established standards. The outcomes of this assessment provide valuable insights for enhancing m-commerce mobile applications, ensuring optimized user experiences.",
