    "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in remote healthcare offer rapid and preventive medical services to individuals at risk, yet predicting heart disease remains a challenging task with often inaccurate diagnosis results. To tackle this challenge, a new Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Utilizing IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been introduced to deliver advanced diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac conditions. Initially, physiological data are remotely collected from patients using four biosensors: ECG, Pressure, Pulse, and Glucose sensors. An Arduino controller gathers the data from these IoT sensors to predict and diagnose diseases. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is developed utilizing a BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model, enabling the diagnosis and classification of cardiovascular diseases into five distinct classes. The recommendation system offers tailored physical and dietary recommendations for cardiac patients based on the categorized data, accessible through a user mobile application. The performance of DEEP-CARDIO is validated using Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) with real-time datasets from Framingham's and Statlog heart disease datasets. DEEP-CARDIO demonstrates an impressive overall accuracy of 99.90%, outperforming other methods such as MABC-SVM (86.91%), HCBDA (88.65%), and MLbPM (93.63%).",
