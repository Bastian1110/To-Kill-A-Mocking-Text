    "text": "Remote healthcare applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) offer rapid and preventive medical services to patients at risk. Despite this, predicting heart disease remains a complex task with diagnosis results often lacking accuracy. To tackle this challenge, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed. DEEP-CARDIO aims to provide early diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, physiological data are remotely collected from patients using four biosensors: ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor, and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives this data from IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. Utilizing a BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model, a cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented to classify the disease into five available cardiovascular classes. The recommendation system offers physical and dietary recommendations to cardiac patients based on classified data through a user mobile application. The performance of DEEP-CARDIO is validated using Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) with real-time Framinghamâ€™s and Statlog heart disease datasets. DEEP-CARDIO achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90%, surpassing other methods such as MABC-SVM (86.91%), HCBDA (88.65%), and MLbPM (93.63%).",
