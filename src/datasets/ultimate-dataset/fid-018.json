    "text": "Utilizing AI and machine learning, notably the vision transformer technique, in bacterial detection offers a promising solution to address the limitations of conventional methods. This advancement facilitates quicker and more precise identification of disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella in water, which is crucial for human well-being. Ongoing research aims to further evaluate its efficacy in microbiology. This study introduces an innovative positional self-attention transformer model for bacterial colony classification. By incorporating a positional self-attention mechanism into the model, inspired by the success of transformer architectures in diverse fields, we enhance its performance. Our novel approach to bacterial colony classification leverages this positional self-attention transformer model, enabling effective capture of spatial relationships and patterns within bacterial colonies. Training the model on a substantial dataset of bacterial images ensures its robustness and ability to generalize to various colony types. The proposed model adeptly captures spatial relationships and sequential patterns inherent in bacterial colony images, leading to highly accurate classification outcomes. Remarkably, the model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.50% in bacterial colony classification, surpassing traditional methods by effectively capturing intricate spatial relationships within microbial structures. Its adaptability to diverse colony shapes and arrangements represents a significant advancement, promising to revolutionize bacterial colony classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The high classification accuracy attained by the model suggests its potential for practical applications in early disease diagnosis and targeted treatment development. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating positional self-attention into transformer models for image-based classification tasks, particularly in the realm of bacterial colony analysis.",
