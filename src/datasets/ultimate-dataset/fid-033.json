    "text": "How might the risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) be distributed among everyday road users? The extensive literature concerning the ethical dimensions of AVs primarily focuses on moral decision-making during unavoidable collision scenarios. We advocate for broadening this discourse to encompass driving behaviors in routine road traffic, where numerous ethical dilemmas arise due to the continual redistribution of risk among motorists. Addressing these risk distributions prompts ethically significant inquiries that cannot be resolved through simplistic rules like 'apply the brakes.' Through an interactive, visual depiction of various traffic scenarios, we gauged participants' preferences regarding AV driving maneuvers in a representative survey conducted in Germany. Notably, participants' preferences diverged significantly from mere collision avoidance strategies. Intriguingly, participants demonstrated a willingness to assume risks themselves to benefit other road users, suggesting that the social quandary surrounding AVs might be alleviated in environments characterized by risk. Our study aims to facilitate a constructive dialogue between engineers and philosophers on the ethical implications of AVs.",
