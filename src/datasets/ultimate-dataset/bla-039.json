    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable element in both production and service systems in recent times, with technology playing a crucial role in daily life. Autonomous vehicles, commonly known as driverless cars, operate independently without human drivers. Research in the field of autonomous vehicles has made significant strides in recent years, highlighting the societal demand for artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles. While some individuals may hesitate to relinquish control of their vehicles to computers, automated driving technologies hold the promise of enhancing road safety. Self-driving cars can address both environmental and safety concerns, as computers do not struggle with maintaining attention while driving. Moreover, through timely responses, automated vehicles can avert potential accidents on the road. The adoption of self-driving technology can benefit individuals who are unable to drive due to various reasons such as inexperience, disability, or age, providing them with safer and more independent transportation options. This chapter will delve into the software and hardware architectures of autonomous vehicles, exploring their components, advantages, and future advancements.",
