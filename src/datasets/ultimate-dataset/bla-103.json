Within this framework, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a key facilitator for initiatives like Smart Logistics and Smart Production. This paper conducts a systematic analysis of scientific literature focusing on AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) within the context of Smart Logistics management in industrial enterprises. Drawing from the findings of this literature review, the authors present a conceptual framework. This framework offers valuable insights and implications derived from recent research findings, serving as a guide for directing future research initiatives in the domain of AI, ML, and DL in Smart Logistics.",
