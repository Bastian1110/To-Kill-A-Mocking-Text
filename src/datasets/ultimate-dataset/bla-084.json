    "text": "Smart cities epitomize the fusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban governance, aimed at enhancing the quality of life for urban residents. Within this framework, recommender systems, which provide personalized suggestions to city dwellers, have emerged as pivotal components of this amalgamation. Their widespread application across various facets of urban life, coupled with their capacity to process vast quantities of data generated within urban environments, has solidified their status as indispensable technologies in the advancement of city planning. Our methodology involved a comprehensive review of the Web of Science database, yielding a total of 130 articles, subsequently narrowed down to 86 articles deemed relevant. The initial phase comprised a bibliometric analysis utilizing the SciMAT tool to examine structural aspects. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 statement guidelines. The findings elucidated diverse recommendation filtering processes across domains such as tourism, healthcare, transportation, and mobility. This research is poised to catalyze advancements and enhance the efficiency of smart cities, laying a robust foundation for future explorations in this dynamic field.",
