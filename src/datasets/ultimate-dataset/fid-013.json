    "text": "Agriculture stands as a vital necessity and primary source of income for many nations. Diseases caused by various pathogens such as viruses, fungi, and bacteria inflict significant financial losses on agricultural enterprises worldwide. Monitoring plant diseases is crucial for ensuring crop security in terms of both quality and quantity. Therefore, the detection of plant diseases is paramount. Symptoms of plant disease manifest in different parts of plants, with leaf infection being the most common. Various researchers employ computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques to automatically identify plant diseases using leaf images. These methods also assist farmers in taking prompt and appropriate measures to prevent crop quality and quantity reduction. Applying these techniques in disease recognition helps overcome the challenge of selective disease feature identification, feature extraction, and enhances technological speed and research efficiency. Additionally, molecular techniques have been developed to mitigate the threat posed by pathogens. Thus, this review aids researchers in automating plant disease detection using machine learning, deep learning, and few-shot learning, and offers diagnostic techniques to prevent disease occurrence. Furthermore, the review discusses future prospects in disease classification.",
