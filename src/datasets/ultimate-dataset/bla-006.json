    "text": "In his ICCE 2019 keynote address (Yang, 2019), Stephen Yang highlighted the emerging challenge of precision education in the application of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics to enhance teaching quality and student learning outcomes. The objective of precision education is to pinpoint students who are at risk at an early stage and to provide them with timely interventions based on their educational experiences (Lu et al., 2018). This special issue is centered on the theme of precision education and promotes a detailed discussion between the objective nature of technology and the subjective aspect of humanity, thereby enriching the understanding of precision education. Included in this special issue are thirteen research papers focused on precision education, AI, machine learning, and learning analytics, which delve into comprehensive research on various applications, methods, educational models, and settings to foster a better comprehension of AIâ€™s role in education.",
