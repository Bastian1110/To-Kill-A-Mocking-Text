    "text": "Over the decades, art has demonstrated its profound impact on rehabilitation therapy and psychological interventions, a fact corroborated by numerous clinical cases since the 1950s. The emergence of artificial intelligence technology has introduced novel possibilities, such as AI painting software based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm model, which facilitates image creation through interactive prompts and feedback. This study ventures into the realm of AI-assisted art therapy, focusing on the potential emotional benefits of AI painting software. By analyzing emotional changes in patients before and after engaging with the AI software, the research aims to shed light on its therapeutic efficacy. Initial findings suggest that AI painting can indeed evoke positive emotional responses, marking a significant stride in the integration of technology with art therapy. This study not only advocates for the development of specialized AI tools for art therapy but also underscores the importance of continued exploration into the unique dynamics between traditional and AI-driven approaches in therapeutic contexts.",
