    "text": "In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has become essential in both production and service systems, reflecting the increasing role of technology in our daily lives. Autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, operate independently without human intervention, marking a significant advancement in automotive research. The demand for artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles is evident, despite some initial apprehension about entrusting vehicle control to computers. However, automated driving technologies hold immense potential for enhancing road safety by addressing environmental and safety challenges. Unlike humans, computers excel at maintaining attention while driving and can respond swiftly to prevent accidents. Self-driving cars also offer accessible transportation options for individuals unable to drive due to various reasons such as inexperience, disability, or age, fostering safer and more independent travel. This chapter will explore the software and hardware architectures of autonomous vehicles, analyzing their components, benefits, and future prospects.",
