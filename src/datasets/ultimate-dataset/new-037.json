    "text": "The advancement of autonomous vehicles relies on a harmonious blend of user-centric design principles and sophisticated AI functionalities. Future autonomous vehicles will not only ferry passengers but also engage with and adapt to their preferences, ensuring a comfortable, streamlined, and enjoyable travel experience. This paper introduces an innovative framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment the decision-making processes of autonomous vehicles. By leveraging the natural language capabilities and contextual understanding of LLMs, combined with specialized tool integration, coherent reasoning, and effective action coordination across various modules within autonomous vehicles, this framework aims to seamlessly incorporate the advanced language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous driving systems. The proposed framework holds promise in revolutionizing the operations of autonomous vehicles, offering personalized assistance, continuous learning, and transparent decision-making, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and more efficient autonomous driving technologies.",
