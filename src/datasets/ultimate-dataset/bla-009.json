    "text": "Engineering education is continuously adapting to align with the latest technological advancements and to meet the evolving demands of the engineering sector. A notable innovation in this realm is the utilization of generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT holds promise in delivering tailored and efficient learning experiences by offering students personalized feedback and explanations, and by facilitating the creation of realistic virtual simulations for experiential learning. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and similar generative AI systems are limited by the quality of their training data and can propagate biases or disseminate misinformation. Moreover, the implementation of generative AI in educational settings introduces ethical dilemmas, including potential misuse by students and the risk of displacing human jobs. Although the current capabilities of generative AI like ChatGPT are remarkable yet imperfect, they represent just an early glimpse of future possibilities. It is vital for engineering educators to grasp the ramifications of this technology and explore how to modify the engineering education landscape to ensure that upcoming engineers are equipped to leverage the advantages of generative AI while mitigating its adverse effects.",
