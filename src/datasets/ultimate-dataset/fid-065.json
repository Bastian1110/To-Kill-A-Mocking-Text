    "text": "Progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to a growing resemblance between AI systems or AI-driven robots and human communication, sparking questions about the potential for effective communication, understanding, and empathy with artificial agents, as well as the attribution of subjectivity and quasi-personal status to them. This blurring boundary between simulated and real encounters raises significant implications.The paper argues that genuine understanding of others requires recognizing the subjectivity of our counterparts, fostering shared emotions and collective intentionality (we-intentionality). This recognition hinges on the notion of a shared form of life, termed conviviality.While future artificial agents may not meet these prerequisites due to the link between subjectivity and consciousness with the aliveness of an organism, the distinction between simulated and real subjectivity could become less clear. The paper explores potential consequences of this blurring boundary, particularly in virtual psychotherapy. It advocates for a mindful approach to language when discussing artificial systems, discouraging the artificial attribution of subjectivity.",
