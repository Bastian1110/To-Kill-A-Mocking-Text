    "text": "Dynamic objects in reality often encounter various random perturbations, significantly compromising control quality. To address this, modern intellectual technology methods are employed for synthesizing control systems of structurally complex dynamic objects, aiming to mitigate the impact of randomness and partial uncertainty. This article delves into the synthesis of automatic control systems for dynamic objects using intelligent control theory. It employs a neural network based on radial-basis functions for neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system at discrete intervals, facilitating real-time parameter adjustment. The radial basis function is tailored to approximate functions expressed in implicit pattern sets. Parameter configuration for the neuro-fuzzy regulator is achieved using a genetic algorithm, enhancing computational efficiency in determining regulator parameters. These parameters are presented as a vector, allowing application to multidimensional objects. The optimal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, characterized by high convergence and the ability to determine global extrema, are determined using a genetic algorithm. The neuro-fuzzy regulator's efficacy lies in its ability to ensure quality control of dynamic objects amidst random perturbations and uncertain input data.",
