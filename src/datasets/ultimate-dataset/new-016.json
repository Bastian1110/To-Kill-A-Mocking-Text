    "text": "A robot-vision system applied for detecting small and slow moving objects is introduced. It utilizes Blob-analysis method to recognize the center of objects with arbitrary form and the angle between axis and arbitrary hypotenuse of objects. An intelligent camera with TMS320C64Ã—series DSP is adopted as the hardware platform of the system. The VC intelligent vidicon is used to fulfill the collection and quantification of scene picture data, and an embedded -operating system and developing platform are involved to implement the corresponding target-localization program. The simulating experiments indicated that the system can meet the requirements of system design, the target recognition rate can reach 100%, and the localization relative error is less than 10%. The system can be widely used to the different machine vision fields in industry with different application programs, especially in picture detection, superficial examination, automotive industry examination and so on.",
