    "text": "There is increasing research into the potential benefits of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms into emergency medical services. AI is finding new applications across a wide range of sectors, one of which is healthcare, where it is being used to enhance clinical diagnostics. AI solutions have enormous untapped potential to improve healthcare efficiency and quality, thus researchers have focused heavily on emergency medicine (EM). Many individuals without prior experience with any physician often receive their initial medical care in the emergency room. Two areas that could benefit from the implementation of AI are reducing waiting times and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. This study provides further explanation of how AI is used in emergency rooms. Several machine learning‚Äêbased algorithms are also addressed. In this research, we summarise recent developments in the use of AI in EM. This research tries to summarise the usefulness of AI in EM by looking at recent developments in emergency department operations and clinical patient management.",
