    "text": "The future of autonomous vehicles hinges on the fusion of human-centric design and advanced AI capabilities. Autonomous vehicles in the future will not only transport passengers but also engage and adapt to their preferences, ensuring a comfortable, efficient, and enjoyable journey. This paper introduces an innovative framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment the decision-making processes of autonomous vehicles. By integrating the natural language abilities and contextual comprehension of LLMs, along with specialized tool usage, merging reasoning, and acting with diverse modules on autonomous vehicles, this framework aims to seamlessly integrate the advanced language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework has the potential to transform the operations of autonomous vehicles, offering personalized assistance, continuous learning, and transparent decision-making, thereby contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous driving technologies.",
