    "text": "Fuzzy logic has emerged as a potent tool for optimizing power flow solutions, particularly in deregulated power systems. By leveraging fuzzy logic controls, the optimal placement of distribution generators (DGs) can be determined, ensuring reliability indices are identified through optimal power flow solutions and fuzzy logic controllers to maintain system feasibility. In a deregulated power system, the strategic placement of distribution generator units plays a pivotal role in minimizing power loss and enhancing overall system performance by mitigating fluctuations. It is crucial to employ optimal power flow algorithms to identify areas of weakness, especially within transmission companies, in a deregulated power system. Both transmission and distribution networks need to be appropriately adjusted to alleviate congestion within the respective companies. The aggregator must assess system performance using data obtained from distribution and transmission companies within the deregulated power system.",
