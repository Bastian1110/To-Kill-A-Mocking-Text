    "text": "Autonomous vehicles, commonly known as driverless cars, operate independently without human drivers. Research on autonomous vehicles has substantially advanced in recent years. Self-driving technology has many advantages, one of which will make more easily accessible means of transport to people who are unable to drive. Although some people might be apprehensive to give a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to make roads safer. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable element in both production and service systems in recent times, with technology playing a crucial role in daily life. These individuals can travel considerably more safely and independently. The adoption of self-driving technology can benefit individuals who are unable to drive due to various reasons such as inexperience, disability, or age, providing them with safer and more independent transportation options. Therefore, we will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments.",
