    "text": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to a growing resemblance between the capabilities of AI systems or AI-driven robots and human communication. This development prompts several questions: Can we effectively communicate with, comprehend, and perhaps empathize with artificial agents? Should we attribute genuine subjectivity and quasi-personal status to them as their simulation approaches a certain level? What implications will arise from the blurring boundary between simulated and authentic encounters?In addressing these questions, the paper argues that true understanding of others requires an implicit acknowledgment of the subjectivity of our counterparts, enabling shared emotions and a collective intentionality (we-intentionality). This acknowledgment fundamentally relies on the assumption of a shared form of life, defined here as conviviality.The paper challenges the notion that future artificial agents could meet these prerequisites, drawing on embodied and enactive cognition theories that tie subjectivity and consciousness to the liveliness of an organism.While genuine subjectivity may remain unattainable for artificial agents, the distinction between simulated and real subjectivity could increasingly blur. The paper explores potential ramifications of this shift, particularly in the context of virtual psychotherapy. Ultimately, it advocates for a mindful approach to the language we employ when discussing artificial systems and urges against a systematic pretense of subjectivity.",
