    "text": "The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and art therapy has unveiled promising avenues for leveraging technology in psychological interventions. This study delves into the potential impact of AI painting software, specifically utilizing the Stable Diffusion algorithm model, on human emotions in art therapy. By tracking emotional changes in patients before and after using the AI painting software, the research aims to measure the software's effectiveness in eliciting positive emotional responses. Preliminary experimental data suggests that AI painting software can indeed have a positive influence on human emotions, presenting a compelling case for further integration of AI in art therapy research. This study paves the way for the development of dedicated AI painting software tailored for art therapy, as well as comparative research between traditional painting methods and AI-assisted techniques in therapeutic settings.",
