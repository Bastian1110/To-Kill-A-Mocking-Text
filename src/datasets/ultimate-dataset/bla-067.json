    "text": "Living organisms exhibit remarkable capabilities due to the manifestation of autonomy in their bodies. From the macro to micro scales, these organisms combine computational and physical intelligence through body morphology, material functionality, and mechanical compliance. While soft robotics has improved physically intelligent body design, integrating information-processing capabilities remains a challenge. Current limitations in perception and control constrain soft robot construction. Achieving untethered autonomy requires coordinated development of new materials, fabrication techniques, and control methods. A novel perspective suggests focusing on tasks to impose material and information constraints on soft robot design, bypassing control strategy limitations. This framework enables leveraging material and information processing properties of soft matter for task-oriented agents. The scale-dependent nature of solutions is emphasized, along with an outlook on future research opportunities for achieving autonomy in soft robots ranging from elephant trunks to paramecia.",
