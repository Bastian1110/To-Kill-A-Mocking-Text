    "text": "The recent evolution in providing computing resources as a service marks a departure from traditional product-based computing purchases to internet-delivered services from expansive data centers. However, as cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) gain prominence, particularly in enhancing customer experience automations like recommender systems (RS), there's a growing demand for modifications to accommodate IoT devices central to automation, alongside emerging technologies such as nanotechnology and recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard. This paper introduces the marketing community to a significant computing advancement: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Despite numerous research studies focusing on FC 'smart' applications, none have delved into fog-based smart marketing domains like recommender systems. FC represents a novel computational system capable of reducing latency and enhancing bandwidth utilization for real-time data-driven decision-making in autonomous consumer behavior applications. The paper presents a conceptual framework for investigating the impact of fog computing on consumer behavior, particularly examining the intersection of FC and RS to inspire future research endeavors. The conceptualization of 'fog-based recommender systems' outlined in this paper offers numerous challenging avenues for academic exploration, as highlighted in subsequent sections. Keywords: fog computing; recommender system; internet of things (IoT); edge computing; artificial intelligence (AI); software-defined networks (SDNs)",
