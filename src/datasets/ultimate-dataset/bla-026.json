    "text": "Facial recognition technology (FRT) has emerged as a prominent artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic to curb the transmission of the virus. As preparations for potential future pandemics are underway, FRT is poised to play a crucial role as an efficient mechanism for tracking infected individuals and gathering real-time surveillance data. When employed judiciously, FRT can bolster governmental efforts to implement robust public health surveillance, which involves the systematic collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination of personal information to detect outbreaks and contain the spread of diseases. However, the widespread adoption of FRT presents a host of ethical and legal quandaries, including concerns regarding consent from individuals under surveillance, safeguarding the privacy of biometric data collected through surveillance, and the potential misuse of this information for purposes beyond public health surveillance. While FRT has found extensive application in countries like Russia and China, both during pandemics and in other contexts, jurisdictions in the western world exhibit greater reluctance towards its adoption, reflecting ongoing debates surrounding its ethical and legal implications.",
