    "text": "The widespread availability of the internet and technological progress has ushered in an era of information abundance, leading to decision-making complexities for users. Recommender Systems (RS) emerge as a promising solution to aid users in decision-making processes by suggesting or predicting product ratings. Collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering represent the three foundational forms of RS, utilizing implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation purposes. While ratings serve as the primary form of feedback, ancillary factors such as product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos also play crucial roles in enhancing traditional RS performance. Incorporating these additional variables can significantly influence RS efficacy. Historically, RSs relied on approaches grounded in nearest neighbor or other machine learning models. However, recent strides in artificial intelligence and deep learning have paved the way for the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in RS development, enabling efficient exploitation of auxiliary information. This article not only compares CNN-based RSs on standardized criteria but also offers an in-depth exploration of CNN-based RSs and their utilization of diverse auxiliary information sources. Furthermore, the study delves into data characteristics, statistics, and auxiliary information across various publicly available datasets. Evaluation measures for RSs are thoroughly examined, accompanied by insights into compelling challenges and ongoing research avenues for interested readers.",
