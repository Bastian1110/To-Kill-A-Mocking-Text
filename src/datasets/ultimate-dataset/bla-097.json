    "text": "This paper delves into the critical aspect of maintaining player engagement by providing an appropriate difficulty level in video games. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) emerges as a pivotal strategy for optimizing player experience through automatic adjustments to game elements. The review comprehensively examines existing literature on mechanisms for adapting video game difficulty based on players' performance, emotions, or personality traits. Drawing on studies employing machine learning techniques, player modeling approaches, and various data types to assess player states, the review sheds light on trends in DDA implementation across different game genres and applications. Analysis of journal articles and conference papers published up to September 2022 reveals compelling insights. Most notably, the findings indicate that DDA has demonstrated significant effects on parameters crucial to player experience, such as enjoyment, flow, motivation, engagement, and immersion. Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on leveraging machine learning and player modeling techniques in DDA design. Despite these advancements, the review underscores the need for further research to deepen our understanding of player preferences and optimize game parameters more effectively. Specifically, exploring players' cognitive characteristics, such as visual attention, working memory, and response time, holds promise for refining DDA strategies and enhancing player satisfaction across diverse gaming contexts.",
