    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly popular in the education sector, offering personalized learning experiences, adaptive testing capabilities and intelligent tutoring systems. Despite these potential benefits to educational quality, there are several challenges that need to be addressed when using AI technology. This literature review aims to examine both the challenges and opportunities of AI in the education world by exploring existing research studies and reports. The analysis considers ethical concerns associated with implementing AI into educational settings as well as its effect on student outcomes and teacher development. In addition, it investigates possible advantages - such as improved student engagement or addressing inequality issues - but also possible drawbacks like a lack of human interaction within classrooms due to automation processes enabled by AI use cases. The findings suggest successful implementation requires careful consideration of ethical considerations along with effective integration into current educational systems for optimal results. Lastly, this review provides recommendations for further exploration in this field along with an emphasis on continued examination of both risks & rewards posed by Artificial Intelligence usage within Education context.",
