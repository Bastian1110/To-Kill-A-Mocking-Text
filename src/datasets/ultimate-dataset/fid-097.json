    "text": "Ensuring an appropriate level of challenge in a game is crucial for maintaining player interest. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) emerges as a popular strategy for enhancing player satisfaction by automatically adapting game elements. This study examines existing literature on mechanisms for altering video game difficulty levels based on player performance, emotions, or personality traits. Our analysis focuses on DDA research utilizing machine learning methods, player modeling strategies, data types for assessing player states, game genres used for testing, and practical applications. We sourced information from journal and conference articles published through September 2022. The results indicate that DDA interventions have had significant impacts on factors such as enjoyment, flow, motivation, engagement, and immersion in most studies. Moreover, recent attention has been directed towards the integration of machine learning and player modeling techniques into DDA frameworks. However, as gaming becomes increasingly prevalent across diverse domains, further investigation is warranted to better understand player preferences and optimize game parameters effectively. Future research should delve deeper into players' cognitive traits, including visual attention, working memory, and response times, to gain deeper insights into player preferences.",
