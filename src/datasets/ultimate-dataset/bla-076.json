    "text": "This article provides a comprehensive exploration of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems encountering infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To surmount these challenges, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are harnessed, and adaptive methodologies are employed to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters inherent in robotic dynamics. Throughout the investigation, the persistent challenges of collision avoidance and connectivity preservation emerge due to limitations in distance and visual fields. To address these hurdles effectively, a novel barrier function and prescribed performance methodology are introduced to mitigate constrained range impediments. Moreover, in a bid to minimize controller executions and offset any repercussions stemming from infinite actuator failures, robots synchronize with their leader upon actuator faults, utilizing fewer network communication resources while ensuring uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory set by the leader. Leveraging dynamic surface technology, a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy is proposed, with a guarantee of semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) signals. Ultimately, through practical demonstrations, the feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems is substantiated.",
