    "text": "Given the rapidly increasing interest in AI within educational, political, and professional circles, this article highlights five key areas of debate that require more thorough examination in future deliberations and policy-making. These areas are: (1) the importance of concentrating on the realities of 'actually existing' AI rather than hypothetical advancements in AI technology; (2) emphasizing the limitations of AI in replicating social contexts and human attributes such as intelligence, decision-making, autonomy, and emotions; (3) highlighting the potential social harms resulting from AI applications; (4) recognizing that assertions about AI are influenced by underlying values; and (5) focusing on the environmental and ecological sustainability of ongoing AI development and its application. This discussion contrasts with the common perception of AI as a neutral instrument, advocating for a view of AI in education as a political issue that affects diverse groups differently across various educational settings.",
