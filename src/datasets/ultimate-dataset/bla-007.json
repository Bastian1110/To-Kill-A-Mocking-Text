    "text": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies become more prevalent in the educational sector, there has been a significant rise in the volume of research published in this area. Despite this increase, there has not been a comprehensive large-scale review that explores the different facets of this field comprehensively. Drawing on 4,519 publications spanning from 2000 to 2019, we aim to bridge this gap and explore trends and topics in AI applications in education (AIEd) through topic-based bibliometric analysis. Our review shows a growing interest within the academic sphere in utilizing AI for educational purposes. Key research areas identified include intelligent tutoring systems tailored for special education; natural language processing aimed at language learning; educational robots designed for teaching AI; educational data mining for predicting student performance; discourse analysis within computer-supported collaborative learning; neural networks applied to teaching evaluations; affective computing for detecting emotions in learners; and recommender systems for customized learning experiences. Challenges and prospective pathways for AIEd are also discussed in detail.",
