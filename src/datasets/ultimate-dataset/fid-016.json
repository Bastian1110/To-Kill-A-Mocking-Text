    "text": "Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) finds widespread application in industrial control, smart home systems, and other domains, garnering favorable responses. However, the effective utilization of AI technology hinges on computer performance capabilities and faces challenges in network security, data analysis, and human-computer interaction. Although embedded system visual platforms have demonstrated notable achievements in practical implementations, their progress is hindered by issues such as low overall development efficiency and system performance instability. This study introduces an EP Vision System (VS) incorporating AI technology. The platform integrates embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to facilitate intelligent robot interaction and target detection functionalities. Test outcomes revealed that, under similar conditions, both students and experts rated System X positively at 83.5% and 90%, respectively, while System Y received positive ratings of only 19% and 4%. Conversely, negative evaluations of System X were lower at 16.5% for students and 10% for experts, compared to 81% and 96% for System Y. These findings suggest that System X effectively meets practical application demands and enhances system recognition efficiency to a significant degree, thereby highlighting the favorable correlation between AI technology and EP VS.",
