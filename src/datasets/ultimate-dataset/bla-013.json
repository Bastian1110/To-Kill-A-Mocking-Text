    "text": "Agriculture stands as a fundamental cornerstone and primary economic driver for numerous countries, providing vital domestic income. Diseases inflicted upon plants by various pathogens such as viruses, fungi, and bacteria result in significant financial losses for agricultural enterprises worldwide. Ensuring the security of crops in terms of both quality and quantity necessitates vigilant monitoring of plant diseases. Therefore, the timely recognition of plant diseases is paramount. Manifestations of plant disease syndromes are observable in various parts of plants, with leaf infection being particularly prevalent. Researchers employ computer vision, deep learning, few-shot learning, and soft computing techniques to automatically detect plant diseases through leaf images. These methodologies not only aid in swift and accurate disease identification but also assist farmers in taking prompt and appropriate measures to mitigate losses in crop quality and quantity. Implementing these techniques in disease recognition helps overcome the challenges of subjective disease feature selection and feature extraction, thus enhancing the speed and efficacy of technological advancements and research efforts. Additionally, molecular techniques have been developed to prevent and mitigate pathogenic threats. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to automate the detection of plant diseases using machine learning, deep learning, and few-shot learning techniques, while also providing diagnostic methods for disease prevention. Furthermore, the review outlines potential future avenues for disease classification research.",
