    "text": "With the increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education, an escalation in the number of studies published in this domain has been observed. However, no comprehensive large-scale reviews have been conducted to investigate the various facets of this field thoroughly. Based on 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019, an attempt is made to bridge this gap and to identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd) through topic-based bibliometrics. The findings of the review indicate a growing interest in the application of AI for educational purposes within the academic community. The principal research topics are found to be intelligent tutoring systems for special education; natural language processing for language education; educational robots for AI education; educational data mining for performance prediction; discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning; neural networks for teaching evaluation; affective computing for detecting learner emotions; and recommender systems for personalized learning. The challenges and future directions of AIEd are also discussed.",
