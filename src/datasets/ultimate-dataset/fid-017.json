    "text": "Implemented in contemporary smart vehicles are numerous foundational models based on Artificial Intelligence. These models are designed for intelligent sensing to identify familiar object categories within novel yet analogous situations. However, the challenge persists for these foundational models in intelligent sensing to accurately detect all object categories across both familiar and unfamiliar scenarios. This correspondence aims to expand the horizons of research in intelligent sensing for smart vehicles. Initially, we outline the prevalent foundational models and the requisite intelligence for intelligent sensing in smart vehicles. Subsequently, we elucidate the Sora-based Parallel Vision approach to enhance foundational models of intelligent sensing, progressing from rudimentary intelligence (1.0) to advanced intelligence (2.0) and ultimately generalized intelligence (3.0). Several illustrative case studies are presented to demonstrate potential applications of Sora-based Parallel Vision, along with its anticipated avenues for future research.",
