    "text": "As highlighted by Stephen Yang during his notable presentation at the ICCE 2019 (Yang, 2019), precision education emerges as a significant challenge in harnessing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and learning analytics to elevate teaching quality and learner outcomes. The fundamental aim of precision education is to swiftly identify students at risk and deliver appropriate interventions based on rich teaching and learning insights (Lu et al., 2018). Building on the core concept of precision education, this special issue promotes a profound conversation between the impersonal nature of technology and the empathetic essence of humanity, thereby enhancing the comprehension of precision education. For this edition, thirteen scholarly articles focusing on precision education, AI, machine learning, and learning analytics were curated to delve into varied applications, methodologies, educational frameworks, and settings, culminating in a deeper appreciation of AI's role in educational advancement.",
