    "text": "This paper presents a methodological approach to evaluating personnel risks within enterprises, employing the fuzzy logic framework to identify and address pertinent issues in personnel risk management. Drawing upon the foundational works of both foreign and domestic scholars, statistical data, and our own research findings, this study adopts a multi-faceted methodological framework incorporating fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, and a comprehensive system-complex approach. The proposed approach entails assessing the level of personnel risks within an enterprise, with numerical experiments conducted on a sample of construction equipment manufacturers to validate its efficacy. Through the analysis of assessment results, key challenges in personnel risk management are identified. The study formulates a mathematical problem, focusing on hierarchical fuzzy data comprising four groups of indicators for personnel risk assessment, each associated with a varying number of fuzzy coefficients. These indicators are functions of fuzzy coefficients, culminating in an integrated indicator representing the personnel risk level. The construction of a fuzzy system necessitates structural elements including membership functions of input and output variables, a rule base, and an output mechanism. Leveraging computational intelligence principles, particularly the theory of fuzzy sets, the developed methodological approach enables the integration of qualitative and quantitative indicators in personnel risk assessment, thereby enhancing decision-making efficacy amidst uncertainty and minimizing costs in adverse scenarios.",
