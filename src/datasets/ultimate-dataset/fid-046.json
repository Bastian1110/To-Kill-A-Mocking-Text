    "text": "The emergence of theory of mind (ToM) in artificial intelligence (AI) due to advances in large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of discussion among researchers. LLMs have the ability to attribute beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions with increasing accuracy, primarily by recognizing linguistic patterns in datasets rather than employing human-like empathy. This raises questions about whether LLMs can empathize and respect individual rights to exceptions, such as evaluating character and predicting behavior with sensitivity to individuality. Can LLMs adequately consider claims of uniqueness based on internal mental states, or are they confined to evaluating cases based on similarities? This discussion emphasizes the importance of empathy in acknowledging exceptions, a value distinct from the predictive accuracy at which LLMs excel. It also proposes avenues for further exploration into the role of empathy in AI, both conceptually and empirically.",
