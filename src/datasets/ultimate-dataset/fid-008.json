    "text": "Given the rapid increase in popular, political, and professional discussions about AI in education, this article identifies five critical areas of debate that should be examined more closely in future deliberations and policy-making. These areas are: (1) ensuring the focus remains on the 'actually existing' AI instead of overly promoting speculative AI technologies; (2) explicitly highlighting AI's shortcomings in modeling social contexts and mimicking human intelligence, reasoning, autonomy, and emotions; (3) emphasizing the social detriments linked with AI usage; (4) recognizing the biased nature of assertions regarding AI; and (5) giving more consideration to the environmental and ecological implications of ongoing AI advancement and deployment. Therefore, contrary to the common view of AI as an impartial instrument, the case is argued for treating the continuous use of AI in education as a political endeavor that affects diverse groups in different educational environments variably.",
