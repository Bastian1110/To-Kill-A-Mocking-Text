    "text": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and neuroscience has emerged as a pivotal area of research, especially concerning the study of the brain and advancements in neurological disorder treatments. Artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms offer valuable insights into neural processing mechanisms and brain functionality. Recent investigations delve into the correlation between neural processes and individual happiness. This study aims to assess the nexus between neuroscience and happiness, leveraging the progress in Artificial Intelligence. Through a bibliometric analysis using articles from the Scopus database spanning 2013-2023 and employing the VOSviewer for data processing, a comprehensive understanding is sought. The analysis revealed 603 relevant articles, with significant scientific contributions primarily from the United States (184), United Kingdom (74), and China (73). Co-occurrence - Author Keywords analysis yielded three distinct clusters: the first cluster (red) focusing on AI applications for happiness prediction, the second cluster (green) centered around AI tools in neuroscience, and the third cluster (blue) exploring neuroscience in psychology. This study underscores the advancements in neuroscience research, particularly in unraveling mental processes like emotions and consciousness, and how AI is augmenting this understanding, especially in exploring well-being and happiness.",
