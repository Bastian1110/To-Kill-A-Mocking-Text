    "text": "With the proliferation of easy internet access and technological advancements, individuals are faced with information overload and an abundance of choices, leading to significant challenges in decision-making. In this context, Recommender Systems (RS) emerge as a promising solution, aiding users by suggesting or forecasting product ratings. Collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering are three fundamental forms of RS, utilizing implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation purposes. While ratings serve as the most common feedback type, additional variables such as product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos also play crucial roles, enhancing the performance of traditional RS. Notably, these supplementary factors can substantially influence RS performance. Traditional RSs traditionally rely on approaches like nearest neighbor or other machine learning models. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning have enabled the development of RSs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which effectively leverage auxiliary information. This article not only compares CNN-based RSs on standardized criteria but also thoroughly examines how they leverage various types of auxiliary information. The study delves into the characteristics of data, data statistics, and auxiliary information across a range of publicly available datasets. Moreover, it explores different evaluation metrics for RSs, presenting readers with intriguing challenges and ongoing research avenues.",
