    "text": "Deep learning techniques have rapidly become important as a preferred method for evaluating medical image segmentation. This survey analyses different contributions in the deep learning medical field, including the major common issues published in recent years, and also discusses the fundamentals of deep learning concepts applicable to medical image segmentation. The study of deep learning can be applied to image categorization, object recognition, segmentation, registration, and other tasks. First, the basic ideas of deep learning techniques, applications, and frameworks are introduced. Deep learning techniques that operate the ideal applications are briefly explained. This paper indicates that there is a previous experience with different techniques in the class of medical image segmentation. Deep learning has been designed to describe and respond to various challenges in the field of medical image analysis such as low accuracy of image classification, low segmentation resolution, and poor image enhancement. Aiming to solve these present issues and improve the evolution of medical image segmentation challenges, we provide suggestions for future research.",
