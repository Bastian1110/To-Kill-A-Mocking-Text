    "text": "The tourism industry has witnessed the integration of artificial intelligence chatbots due to their cost-effectiveness and efficiency. However, there has been limited research on the impact of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes. Leveraging the expectancy violations theory, we investigated how emotional expressions of chatbots influence customer satisfaction through three experiments focusing on tourist attraction recommendations. Expressing concern for customers can enhance customer satisfaction by minimizing expectancy violations. Notably, customer goal orientation, the human-like appearance of chatbot avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots can moderate the inverse relationship between emotional expression and expectancy violation. These findings contribute to the understanding of chatbot emotional expressions and offer valuable insights for the strategic deployment of chatbots in customer service within the tourism sector.",
