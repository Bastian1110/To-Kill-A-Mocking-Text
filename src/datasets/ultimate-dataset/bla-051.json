    "text": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to various industries relying heavily on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. However, the opacity and black box effect of deep neural networks mean that we often obtain results without understanding the underlying reasoning behind them. This lack of transparency has raised skepticism and resistance in certain circles towards deep learning technologies. In areas such as emotion analysis used for business and public opinion monitoring, decision-makers may struggle to trust the outcomes generated by supposedly emotionless machines without explanations. While there are mathematical-based explanation methods that generally treat emotion analysis as a classification task, emotions are distinct from other task categories due to their human-specific factors and logic. This paper introduces an emotion analysis explanation framework rooted in psychological theories that focus on stimuli from classic emotion theories. The proposed framework emphasizes exploring the cause and trigger of emotions as explanations for deep learning-based emotion analysis, comprising two main components: identifying the emotion cause and visualizing emotion-triggering words.",
