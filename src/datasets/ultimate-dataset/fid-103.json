    "text": "Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies drive the continuous evolution of micro- and macro-economic entities by emphasizing interconnection, digitization, and automation principles. Within this framework, artificial intelligence emerges as a crucial facilitator for initiatives like Smart Logistics and Smart Production. This paper conducts a thorough analysis of scholarly literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning within the realm of Smart Logistics management in industrial settings. Additionally, drawing from the outcomes of the systematic literature review, the authors introduce a conceptual framework. This framework offers valuable implications derived from recent research discoveries and insights, serving as a guide for shaping and initiating future research endeavors in the artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) domains within Smart Logistics.",
