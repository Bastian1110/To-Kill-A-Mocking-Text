    "text": "The primary focus of this paper lies in substantiating a methodological approach to evaluating personnel risks in enterprises, leveraging the fuzzy logic framework to identify management issues and provide suitable recommendations. Drawing upon classic principles, foundational works of foreign and domestic scholars, statistical data, and our own research findings, this study employs methods such as fuzzy set theory, comparative analysis, scientific abstraction, and a comprehensive system-complex approach. We propose a methodological framework for assessing personnel risk levels within enterprises, conducting numerical experiments within a group of construction equipment manufacturers to validate our approach. Hierarchical fuzzy data is considered, encompassing four indicator groups for personnel risk assessment, each associated with a different number of fuzzy coefficients. These coefficients are functions of various input variables, with expert evaluations categorized into three terms: Low (I), Medium (G), High (E). Employing a fuzzy system necessitates structural components including membership functions, a rule base, and an output mechanism. Through formalizing our model using FST, we estimate personnel risk levels, facilitating the formulation of strategies to enhance operational efficiency. Our fuzzy logical inference system integrates qualitative and quantitative indicators, enhancing decision-making efficacy under uncertain conditions and reducing costs during adverse scenarios. This methodological approach stands out for its comprehensive consideration of personnel risk factors and movement indicators, offering a robust framework for enterprise risk management.",
