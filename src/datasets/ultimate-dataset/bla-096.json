    "text": "In scientific disciplines such as biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology, precise tracking of animal behavior is crucial for research purposes, often without the use of physical markers. However, accurately capturing animal movements against constantly shifting backgrounds has posed a significant challenge. Recently, we introduced an open-source toolkit featuring a state-of-the-art algorithm designed to estimate animal positions with high accuracy. This toolkit empowers users to train deep neural networks that can precisely monitor user-defined features, achieving tracking accuracy comparable to human labeling. In our latest update to this Python module, we have introduced several enhancements to further improve user experience and tracking performance. These include the integration of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for ease of use, efficiency optimizations to enhance processing speed, and refinement of the neural network through active learning techniques. Our aim is to assist researchers in developing unique and reproducible analysis pipelines, leveraging the computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs) to accelerate data processing and streamline the research workflow. With these advancements, we aim to provide scientists with robust tools to conduct rigorous and insightful studies across various scientific disciplines.",
