    "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi, India, a critical issue arose when around 1,500 COVID-19-positive patients were reported missing. Public health emergencies, such as pandemics or natural disasters, often overwhelm hospitals and medical centers, leading to challenges in patient management, particularly in tracking individuals as they are transferred between facilities or relocated to temporary healthcare setups. These circumstances can result in an increase in missing person cases, with patients inadvertently separated from their families. Recognizing the human face as a unique biometric identifier capable of conveying age, gender, mood, and identity, leveraging deep learning and artificial intelligence becomes paramount. Among the myriad applications of computer vision, patient identification emerges as a crucial area. In this study, we propose a cutting-edge patient face detection model employing a two-stage approach. First, we utilize MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network) for face detection and alignment, followed by the application of FaceNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a renowned face embedding algorithm. Finally, a KNN algorithm serves as a classifier, yielding an impressive accuracy of 97.1%. Additionally, to ensure public safety amid the pandemic, we have developed a ResNet34 model for mask detection, trained on the Face Mask Detection dataset, achieving an accuracy of 97%. This comprehensive study not only addresses the immediate challenges of patient identification and safety during crises but also holds broader implications for healthcare applications. The proposed models offer promising avenues for enhancing patient care and security in healthcare settings.",
