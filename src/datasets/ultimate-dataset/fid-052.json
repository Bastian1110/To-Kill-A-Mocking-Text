    "text": "Artificial intelligence chatbots have entered the tourism industry due to their cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. However, the impact of emotional expressions of chatbots on service outcomes has not garnered sufficient attention from researchers. Building on the expectancy violations theory, we investigated how emotional expressions of chatbots influence customer satisfaction in three experiments focusing on tourist attraction recommendations. Expressing concern for customers can enhance customer satisfaction by reducing expectancy violations. Interestingly, factors such as customer goal orientation, the human-like appearance of chatbot avatars, and the relationship type between customers and chatbots can moderate the negative impact of emotional expression on expectancy violation. These findings contribute to understanding chatbot emotional expressions and offer strategic insights for deploying chatbots effectively in customer service within the tourism industry.",
