    "text": "The quest for biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICA) has propelled remarkable strides in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Yet, a critical facet often overlooked in existing BICA models is the incorporation of human-like emotions and feelings. This study embarks on a journey to delve into the realms of an emotion-integrated cognitive architecture, aiming to emulate human emotional processing within the realms of computational frameworks. Our proposed framework, Emotion-Integrated Cognitive Architecture (EICA), draws inspiration from cutting-edge insights in cognitive psychology, neurobiology, neuroscience, and affective computing. EICA endeavors to infuse emotional processing at the core of AI systems, fostering robust, adaptable agents capable of navigating intricate, dynamic environments with a semblance of human-like emotional intelligence. Leveraging advancements in brain imaging and recording techniques, the EICA model delves into the neural underpinnings of emotions in humans, incorporating emotion-generating, recognition, and regulation mechanisms. This enables AI agents to not only perceive and interpret emotions in themselves but also respond empathetically to emotions in others. Our exploration of EICA encompasses its modular structure, interaction with cognitive components, and successful deployment in diverse AI applications, from virtual assistants to adaptive robotics. This study marks a significant stride towards meeting the BICA Challenge, charting the course for computational emulation of human emotional intelligence and fostering deeper synergies between artificial and biological intelligences.",
