    "text": "As education and technology progress, educators increasingly recognize that games should serve not only as entertainment for students but also as effective tools for teaching. Integrating games into educational resources can lead to improved teaching outcomes. However, the internet continually introduces new resources, making it challenging to provide high-quality recommendations. To address this, we propose a personalized recommendation model for educational video game resources based on knowledge graphs. Initially, feature extraction is conducted iteratively on both the user and item sides. Next, we incorporate a hidden Markov model into the dual end neighbor algorithm to account for the temporal aspect of user behavior, optimizing the model accordingly. This optimized model considers users' long-term and short-term preferences, uncovering their latent preferences. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the designed model achieves a hit rate index value of 0.7989 and a normalized cumulative gain value of 0.6045. Additionally, over 89% of users express satisfaction with the model's recommendations, and it operates efficiently with a runtime of 0.2863 seconds. Thus, the proposed model efficiently delivers high-quality recommendations for educational video game resources, offering users a more convenient and effective online experience.",
