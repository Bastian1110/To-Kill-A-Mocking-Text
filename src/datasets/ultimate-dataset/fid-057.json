    "text": "In the realm of cognitive architectures, the pursuit of biologically inspired models has spurred significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, a critical aspect often overlooked in these models is the integration of emotions and feelings akin to human intelligence. This investigation delves into the realm of an emotion-integrated cognitive architecture, aptly named Emotion-Integrated Cognitive Architecture (EICA), which seeks to replicate human emotional processing within a computational framework. Drawing insights from cognitive psychology, neurobiology, neuroscience, and affective computing, EICA endeavors to infuse emotional processing into the core of AI systems. This integration aims to equip AI agents with robust emotional intelligence, enabling them to navigate complex, dynamic environments with human-like adaptability and sensitivity. Through leveraging advancements in brain imaging and recording techniques, EICA delves into the neural substrates of emotions, encompassing emotion-generating, recognition, and regulation mechanisms. This holistic approach empowers AI agents not only to comprehend and interpret emotions within themselves but also to empathetically respond to emotional cues in others. The conceptualization of EICA, its modular structure, and its symbiotic interaction with cognitive components are explored, alongside successful implementations across diverse AI applications, ranging from virtual assistants to adaptive robotics. This study marks a significant stride towards bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligences, fostering a deeper understanding and synergy between computational and human emotional intelligence.",
