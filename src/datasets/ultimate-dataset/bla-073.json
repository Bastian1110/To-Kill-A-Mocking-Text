    "text": "The utilization of fuzzy logic for quantifying the anticipated usability of an m-commerce mobile application is an intricate process grounded in the application of fuzzy logic principles. This method serves to gauge the usability of a mobile application by scrutinizing the expectations and preferences of users, thereby providing valuable insights into the user experience. Fuzzy logic, revered for its adaptability and precision, emerges as the preferred approach for this quantification endeavor. Through the fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectations, the user experience of an m-commerce mobile application is meticulously evaluated, encompassing factors such as user needs, preferences, and expectations. Moreover, this assessment encompasses the user's ability to comprehend and engage with the application, the extent to which it aligns with user expectations, and overall satisfaction levels. This systematic process not only facilitates the identification of areas necessitating improvement but also empowers developers to effectuate necessary alterations to enhance user experience. The study introduces a robust framework for measuring usability metrics, drawing inspiration from the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach. This framework, tailored specifically for m-commerce contexts, furnishes a comprehensive and structured methodology for designing metrics to evaluate the qualitative aspects of mobile applications. Through rigorous development and validation, the framework offers a standardized set of criteria to quantify m-commerce mobile applications, ensuring consistency and reliability in assessment. The outcomes of this evaluation hold significant implications, guiding enhancements to m-commerce mobile applications and ensuring optimal user experiences.",
