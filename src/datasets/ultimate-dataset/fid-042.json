    "text": "Empathy computing is an emerging research field that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology to predict, identify, simulate, and generate human empathy. Empathy computing research is broadly categorized into four themes, each serving distinct purposes and employing different methodologies. This article critically reviews the current state of research on empathy computing and outlines future directions, with a focus on advancing foundational research and practical applications. Empathy computing represents a frontier in understanding and promoting empathy in the context of human-AI relationships. By leveraging AI and big data, empathy computing enables personalized and empathetic interactions, enhancing user experiences and fostering trust. Empathy computing has demonstrated potential for transformative applications across various domains, including mental health, education, business services, and public management. However, concerns regarding safety and ethics necessitate a collaborative approach between humans and computers in performing empathetic tasks. Despite being in its early stages, empathy computing extends traditional studies on empathy into new territories, raising questions about the universality of empathy and its evolution in human-computer interaction. Future research should focus on developing integrated theoretical models, establishing reliable datasets, and refining empathy computing.",
