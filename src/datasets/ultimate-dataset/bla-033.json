    "text": "How might individuals allocate risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs) within typical road traffic scenarios? Extensive literature on AV ethics primarily focuses on moral decisions during inevitable collision scenarios. We propose broadening this discourse to encompass driving conduct in everyday traffic situations, where numerous ethical dilemmas arise from the continual redistribution of risk among road participants. This redistribution prompts ethically pertinent inquiries that cannot be addressed through simplistic guidelines such as mere braking reflexes. Through an interactive graphical interface depicting various traffic scenarios, we gauged participants' inclinations towards AV driving maneuvers in a comprehensive survey conducted in Germany. Notably, participants' inclinations diverged significantly from mere collision avoidance strategies. Intriguingly, participants demonstrated a willingness to assume risks themselves to benefit other road users, indicating that the social quandary of AVs might be alleviated within risky environments. Our study aims to foster constructive dialogue between engineers and philosophers concerning the ethical dimensions of AVs.",
