    "text": "The lifestyle of contemporary society has undergone significant transformation with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies in recent times. Artificial intelligence encompasses various dimensions, including advanced algorithms, ML, and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are anticipated to furnish automated tools to ophthalmologists for the timely diagnosis and treatment of ocular disorders in the foreseeable future. Indeed, AI, ML, and DL have found applications in ophthalmology for validating disease diagnoses, interpreting images, conducting corneal topographic mapping, and calculating intraocular lens prescriptions. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma stand as the three most prevalent causes of irreversible blindness globally. Ophthalmic imaging offers a means to diagnose and objectively monitor the progression of various pathologies, including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic conditions. Fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are the two primary imaging methods employed in ophthalmic diagnostics. Notably, OCT has emerged as the predominant imaging modality in developed nations' ophthalmic practices. Shifts in population demographics and lifestyle, coupled with increased average lifespans and evolving patterns of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, contribute to the growing demand for such imaging. Moreover, the scarcity of retina specialists and trained graders poses a significant challenge in many regions. Consequently, given current population growth trends, the analysis of such images is bound to be time-intensive, costly, and susceptible to human error. Hence, the development of unmanned automated systems for the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders in the near future appears inevitable. This paper offers an overview of the potential implications of existing AI, ML, and DL methods and their applications in facilitating the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic ailments.",
