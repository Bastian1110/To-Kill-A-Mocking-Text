    "text": "By 2021, over 30 nations had formulated national artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. These strategies outline anticipated impacts of AI on various policy sectors, including education, and often address the societal and ethical considerations of AI usage. This article conducts a thematic analysis of 24 national AI strategies, examining the integration of education within the global AI policy discourse. The findings reveal that discussions on AI in education (AIED) are notably missing from these policy debates, whereas the importance of education in creating an AI-ready workforce and cultivating AI professionals is emphasized. Additionally, the ethical aspects of AIED are minimally covered, despite the general prominence of AI ethics in these strategies. This indicates that AIED, along with its policy and ethical repercussions—whether positive or negative—has not penetrated the mainstream consciousness nor the priorities of influential policymakers, a critical issue considering that effective policy and ethical scrutiny are closely connected, as advocated by this article. In response to these observations, the article proposes a set of five AI ethics principles to help policymakers better integrate the consequences of AIED. It also provides guidance for AIED researchers on how to engage with the policymaking process and conduct research focused on ethics and policy to influence public policy discussions positively.",
