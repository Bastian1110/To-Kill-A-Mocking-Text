    "text": "This paper delves into recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing attention it is receiving in the media. It specifically focuses on Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence alignment, who seeks to bridge the gap between public perceptions and rationalist viewpoints on AI technology. The analysis centers on his proposed course of action for AI, as outlined in his unpublished paper titled AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities. The paper aims to understand the concept of intelligence itself and establish a reasonable working definition. It then applies this definition to contemporary AI capabilities and developments to assess their applicability. The paper concludes that modern AI systems demonstrate a degree of intelligence. However, it argues that both weak and strong AI systems, lacking human-defined goals, do not inherently pose existential threats to humanity. This challenges prevalent notions of AI alignment and questions the validity of Nick Bostrom's Orthogonality Thesis. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential for creating artificial life by assembling modules that emulate separate mind functions.",
