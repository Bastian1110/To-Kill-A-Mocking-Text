    "text": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies has significantly transformed modern society's lifestyle. With their multidimensional capabilities, including advanced algorithms, ML, and DL, these technologies are poised to revolutionize ophthalmology by providing automated solutions for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders.In ophthalmic settings, AI, ML, and DL have already proven instrumental in validating disease diagnoses, interpreting images, conducting corneal topographic mapping, and calculating intraocular lens parameters. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma, three prevalent causes of irreversible blindness globally, stand to benefit immensely from these advancements.Ophthalmic imaging, particularly through fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT), offers a crucial diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring the progression of various pathologies. OCT, in particular, has emerged as the most widely utilized imaging modality in developed countries' ophthalmology practices.However, challenges such as population growth, changing demographics, and limited availability of retina specialists and trained human graders underscore the need for automated solutions. Analyzing ophthalmic images manually is time-consuming, expensive, and susceptible to human error.Therefore, the development of unmanned automated application systems for detecting and treating DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ocular disorders is inevitable. These systems, leveraging AI, ML, and DL methods, hold immense potential for facilitating early detection and intervention, thereby mitigating vision loss and improving patient outcomes.In summary, the integration of AI, ML, and DL technologies in ophthalmology promises to revolutionize the early detection and treatment of ocular diseases, offering a paradigm shift in the way these conditions are managed and improving accessibility to care globally.",
