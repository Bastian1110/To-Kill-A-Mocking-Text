    "text": "Artificial intelligence, an emergent technology, emulates human intelligence in machines by programming them to replicate human thought processes and actions. An autonomous vehicle operates independently, performing tasks without human intervention. This groundbreaking technology holds promise for enhancing passenger safety, reducing traffic congestion, optimizing traffic flow, minimizing fuel consumption, decreasing pollution, and enhancing travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles have significant applications across industries such as agriculture, transportation, and the military. Their operations rely on sensor data and several artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence encompasses data collection, path planning, and execution in autonomous vehicles, necessitating the use of machine learning techniques. However, this advancement raises concerns regarding privacy and security. Security emerges as a critical issue for autonomous vehicles, particularly in relation to cybersecurity concerns associated with integrating artificial intelligence. This article addresses the challenges posed by cybersecurity while incorporating artificial intelligence into autonomous vehicles, alongside advancements in self-driving automobile technology.",
