    "text": "In recent years, propelled by continuous advancements in science and technology, notably in artificial intelligence and machine algorithms, the education system has undergone a transformative shift towards personalized content delivery. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all approaches, personalized education systems, enhanced by machine learning algorithms, cater to the unique needs and learning styles of individual students. By analyzing each student's learning history, interests, and abilities, these systems offer customized learning materials and recommendations, thus improving learning outcomes. Moreover, machine learning algorithms facilitate real-time feedback on student performance, enabling adjustments to learning plans accordingly, rendering the learning process more dynamic and personalized. This personalized approach finds application across various domains including language learning, mathematics, and science. However, optimizing machine learning algorithms to enhance efficiency hinges on improving numerical optimization algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of existing machine learning algorithms for optimizing personalized education recommendation systems, elucidating the algorithm optimization process.",
