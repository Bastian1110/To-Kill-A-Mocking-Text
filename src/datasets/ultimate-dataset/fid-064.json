    "text": "This study examines the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerning data integrity and its societal influence. Using a cross-sectional survey approach, primary data was collected from 650 AI professionals across various sectors, including developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. The study investigates the relationships between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and experience in AI practice with the effectiveness of AI implementation and data integrity. Results reveal a strong positive correlation between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived effectiveness in AI implementation, as well as between awareness of AI ethics and assurance of data integrity. Additionally, professional training in AI is found to have a notable impact on social dynamics, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and continuous education in shaping AI development and its societal implications. The study emphasizes the need for adaptable regulatory frameworks that can align AI practices with societal values and ethical norms. Future research directions include exploring AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies on AI ethics.",
