    "text": "Methodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology, relying on secondary data collected without fieldwork. This secondary data, comprising existing studies, reports, and statistics, was easily accessible through online journals and library resources.Purpose: The general purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of recommender systems in knowledge discovery.Findings: The findings indicate a contextual and methodological gap in recommender systems for knowledge discovery. They highlight the pivotal role of such systems in aiding users' exploration of vast information repositories and expanding their knowledge. Recommender systems employing advanced algorithms and personalized techniques prove more effective in generating relevant recommendations. Moreover, the study underscores the positive correlation between user engagement metrics and knowledge discovery outcomes, stressing the need for active user participation. Contextual information emerges as a crucial factor influencing recommendation effectiveness. The study emphasizes the continuous refinement of recommender system algorithms to enhance knowledge discovery outcomes.Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice, and Policy: Future studies on recommender systems in knowledge discovery may be anchored in Social Learning theory, Information Foraging theory, and Cognitive Load theory. The study offers recommendations to enhance system efficacy, including the adoption of hybrid recommender systems and the integration of contextual information into recommendation algorithms. Additionally, it advocates for the use of explainable AI techniques to improve transparency and user understanding. Maximizing user engagement and prioritizing recommendation diversity are also highlighted as crucial factors.",
