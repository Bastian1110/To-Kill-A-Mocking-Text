    "text": "Plant pathogens can decimate crops and render the local cultivation of a species unprofitable. In extreme cases this has caused famine and economic collapse. Timing is vital in treating crop diseases, and the use of computer vision for precise disease detection and timing of pesticide application is gaining popularity. Computer vision can reduce labour costs, prevent misdiagnosis of disease, and prevent misapplication of pesticides. Pesticide misapplication is both financially costly and can exacerbate pesticide resistance and pollution. Here, we review the application and development of computer vision and machine learning methods for the detection of plant disease. This review goes beyond the scope of previous works to discuss important technical concepts and considerations when applying computer vision to plant pathology. We present new case studies on adapting standard computer vision methods and review techniques for acquiring training data, the use of diagnostic tools from biology, and the inspection of informative features. In addition to an in‚Äêdepth discussion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, we also highlight the strengths of methods such as support vector machines and evolved neural networks. We discuss the benefits of carefully curating training data and consider situations where less computationally expensive techniques are advantageous. This includes a comparison of popular model architectures and a guide to their implementation.",
