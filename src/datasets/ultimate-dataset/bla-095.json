    "text": "In the realm of international relations scholarship, there has been a longstanding recognition of the potential influence of popular culture on public perceptions and political landscapes. This article delves into this dynamic within the sphere of military-themed video games, particularly examining their portrayal of weaponized artificial intelligence (AI). Through an exploration of the paradoxical representations found within these games, wherein AI weapons are depicted both as formidable adversaries posing existential threats to humanity in narratives and as easily conquerable foes routinely defeated by human protagonists in gameplay, we uncover distortions in the depiction of human-machine interaction that diverge from real-world scenarios. These distortions stem from the unique affordances granted to players within video games, allowing for heightened human agency in overcoming AI adversaries to ensure enjoyable gameplay experiences. This portrayal stands in stark contrast to the intended function of AI weapons in actual combat situations, where their purpose is to diminish human agency. Drawing upon the concept of 'translation' from Actor-Network Theory, we elucidate how these distorted depictions of AI weapons arise from complex entanglements between diverse human and non-human actors, all aimed at maximizing the marketability and profitability of video games. By shedding light on these phenomena, we echo the call from game studies research for a deeper examination of the commercial and ludic dimensions of video games. This perspective allows international relations scholarship to more effectively account for the nuanced ways in which popular culture, including video games, shapes public perceptions and political realities, while also recognizing the inherent limitations of its impact.",
