    "text": "The recent evolution in delivering computing resources as a service to both managers and consumers marks a departure from the conventional model of purchasing computing as a product, towards a service-oriented approach delivered via the internet from large-scale data centers. However, the emergence of cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which are revolutionizing customer experience automation across various domains such as recommender systems (RS), has underscored the need for adaptations to accommodate IoT devices, including recent advancements like ChatGPT and Bard language models, as well as nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a cutting-edge computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Despite extensive research on FC applications in 'smart' contexts, little attention has been paid to fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC represents an innovative computational framework capable of reducing latency and enhancing bandwidth utilization, particularly beneficial for autonomous consumer behavior applications demanding real-time data-driven decision-making. This paper presents a conceptual framework for investigating the impact of fog computing on consumer behavior, focusing on the intersection of FC and RS as an illustrative example. Indeed, our conceptualization of 'fog-based recommender systems' unveils numerous unexplored and challenging avenues for academic inquiry, some of which are outlined later in this paper.
