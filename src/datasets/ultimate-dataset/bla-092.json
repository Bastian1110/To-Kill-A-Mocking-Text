    "text": "This paper introduces a novel approach to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) tailored specifically for commercial real-time video games, addressing a domain that has posed challenges for traditional MCTS algorithms. While MCTS, particularly when augmented with Deep Learning (DL), has excelled in mastering board games, its success in real-time video games has been limited due to constraints such as the time limit for exploration during gameplay simulations. Real-time video games are inherently designed for human players and demand significant computational resources for simulation. In response to these challenges, the paper proposes a surrogate-assisted MCTS approach, which leverages a deep-learning-based surrogate model to approximate gameplay outcomes. This approach aims to optimize decision-making in real-time video games by efficiently exploring game states and selecting actions based on the surrogate model's predictions. The key innovation of this work lies in the adaptation of MCTS for the complex and dynamic nature of commercial real-time video games, which cater to diverse market consumers. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the paper conducts a comparative experiment with traditional MCTS and other algorithms within the context of a commercial real-time video game environment. By demonstrating the performance of the surrogate-assisted MCTS approach, the paper provides valuable insights into enhancing decision-making algorithms for real-time video games, thus advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging domain.",
