    "text": "Our research conducted a content analysis of studies that sought to reveal the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) within the educational sector and to identify upcoming research directions and challenges of AI in this field. We analyzed 100 studies, comprising 63 empirical studies (covering 74 reports) and 37 analytical studies, selected from the education and educational research categories of the Social Sciences Citation Index database spanning from 2010 to 2020. Our analysis categorizes the research questions into three layers: the development layer (involving classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), the application layer (including feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and the integration layer (featuring affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). We also identified four emerging research trends—Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience—and discussed the evaluation of AI in education. Additionally, we highlighted potential challenges due to AI's deployment in education, such as the inappropriate use of AI tools, evolving roles of teachers and students, and various social and ethical concerns. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of AI usage in the educational field, bolstering the theoretical base of AI in education and suggesting a viable pathway for future collaborative endeavors between educators and AI professionals.",
