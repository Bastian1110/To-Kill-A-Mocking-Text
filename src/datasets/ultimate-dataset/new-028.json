    "text": "This research pursues the question of how the computer-generated analysis and visualization of communication can foster collaboration in teams that work together online. The audio data of regular online video meetings of three different teams were analyzed. Structural information regarding their communication was visualized in a communication report, and then, discussed with the teams in so-called digitally supported coaching (DSC) sessions. The aim of the DSC is to improve team collaboration by discerning helpful and less helpful patterns in the teams’ communication. This report allows us to recognize individual positions within the teams, as well as communication structures, such as conversational turn taking, that are relevant for group intelligence, as other research has shown. The findings pertaining to the team members during the DSC were gathered via questionnaires. These qualitative data were then matched with the quantitative data derived from the calls, particularly social network analysis (SNA). The SNA was inferred using the average number of interactions between the participants as measured in the calls. The qualitative findings of the teams were then cross-checked with the quantitative analysis. As a result, the assessment of team members’ roles was highly coherent with the SNA. Furthermore, all teams managed to derive concrete measures for improving their collaboration based on the reflection in the DSC.",
