    "text": "In this examination, a content analysis was conducted to uncover the ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) is utilized in the education sector and to determine emerging research trends and the challenges AI presents in this area. A review of 100 scholarly articles, including 63 empirical studies (which encompass 74 investigations) and 37 analytical articles, was undertaken from the education and educational research sections of the Social Sciences Citation Index from the years 2010 through 2020. The analysis identified that the research questions fall into three categories: the development layer (encompassing classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), the application layer (including feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and the integration layer (comprising emotion computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Furthermore, it proposed four key areas for future research: Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, along with a critical assessment of AI's role in education. Challenges were also noted, including the potential misuse of AI technologies, shifts in the roles of teachers and students, and various social and ethical dilemmas. The findings offer a broad perspective on the application of AI in education, aiming to bolster the theoretical underpinnings of AI in this field and to foster ongoing collaboration between educators and AI developers.",
