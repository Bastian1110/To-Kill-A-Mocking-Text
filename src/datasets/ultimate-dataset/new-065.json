    "text": "The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to a convergence between AI systems or AI-driven robots and human communication. This convergence raises crucial questions: Can we effectively engage in communication with, understand, and even empathize with artificial agents? Should we attribute genuine subjectivity and quasi-personal status to them as their simulation approaches a certain level? What consequences will arise from the blurring line between simulated and real encounters?To address these inquiries, the paper posits that authentic understanding of others necessitates an underlying recognition of the subjectivity of our counterparts, fostering shared emotions and a collective we-intentionality. This recognition is grounded in the notion of a shared form of life, defined here as conviviality.The paper challenges the feasibility of future artificial agents meeting these prerequisites, drawing on insights from embodied and enactive cognition theories linking subjectivity and consciousness to the vitality of an organism.While true subjectivity may remain unattainable for artificial agents, the distinction between simulated and real subjectivity could become increasingly indistinct. The paper explores potential implications of this blurring boundary, particularly in the realm of virtual psychotherapy. It advocates for a thoughtful approach to the language we employ when discussing artificial systems and cautions against artificially attributing subjectivity where it does not genuinely exist.",
