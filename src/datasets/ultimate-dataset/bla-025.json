    "text": "Facial recognition stands as a well-established and widely embraced domain within Computer Vision, particularly with the advent of deep learning techniques and enriched datasets. The strides made in deep facial recognition have propelled its utilization across diverse real-world applications. A holistic facial recognition system typically comprises three core elements: facial detection, alignment, and representation. This intricate system is adept at detecting faces, aligning them to a standardized orientation, and extracting discriminative features for recognition, leveraging the prowess of deep convolutional neural networks. This article offers an exhaustive overview of the latest breakthroughs in these domains, illuminating the transformative impact of deep learning on their efficacy and performance. Despite the remarkable progress witnessed in image classification accuracy, nearing human-level performance at approximately 2.25%, the realm of object detection in machine vision remains a formidable challenge with ample room for improvement. Presently, object detection algorithms lag behind, achieving only 40.8 Mean Average Precision Scores (MAPS) on contemporary objects. Hence, meticulous dataset curation and selection play a pivotal role in optimizing the efficacy and performance of object detection algorithms, laying the foundation for future advancements in this critical area of computer vision.",
