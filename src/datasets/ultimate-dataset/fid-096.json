    "text": "Toolset open-source unveiled recently an, that makes use of a cutting-edge algorithm for estimating human position, particularly without employing markers, it is essential to accurately track the behavior of animals throughout studies, including biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology. With the help of this toolbox, users may train a deep neural network to accurately monitor user-defined features with tracking accuracy that rivals that of human labeling. New features have been added to this revised Python module, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), efficiency improvements, and network refinement based on active learning. In order to help customers create a unique and repeatable analysis pipeline using a graphical processing unit (GPU).",
