    "text": "By 2021, over 30 nations have developed national strategies concerning artificial intelligence (AI) policies. These policies delineate plans and set forth expectations on the influence of AI across various policy areas, including the sector of education, and they typically address the social and ethical consequences of AI deployment. This paper conducts a thematic analysis of 24 national AI policy strategies, examining the role of education within the global AI policy dialogue. It notes that discussions on artificial intelligence in education (AIED) are largely missing from these policy debates, while the functional value of education in cultivating an AI-ready workforce and educating more AI specialists is highly emphasized. Moreover, the ethical concerns of AIED are barely considered even though the discussion of AI ethics is quite prevalent within these strategies. This indicates that AIED, along with its wider policy and ethical considerations—whether positive or negative—has not captured mainstream attention nor the focus of important policymakers, a worrying issue considering the vital need for effective policy and thorough ethical scrutiny, as argued in this paper. Given these observations, the paper utilizes a framework of five AI ethics principles to explore how policy creators might better integrate the implications of AIED. It also provides advice for AIED researchers on methods for engaging with the policymaking process and conducting ethics and policy-focused AIED studies, with the aim of influencing policy discussions for the benefit of the public interest.",
