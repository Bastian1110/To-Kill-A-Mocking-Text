The presence of diverse random perturbations in real-world objects significantly impacts the quality of control processes, necessitating the use of modern intelligent technology methods to address the synthesis of control systems for structurally complex dynamic objects. This article delves into the synthesis of automatic control systems for dynamic objects through the application of intelligent control theory. Specifically, a neural network based on radial-basis functions is employed at discrete intervals for neuro-fuzzy approximation of the control system, enabling real-time adjustment of regulator parameters. The radial basis function is designed to approximate functions specified in the implicit form of pattern sets. Utilizing a genetic algorithm, the configuration of parameters for the neuro-fuzzy regulator is achieved, leading to more efficient computation in determining the regulator's parameter set. Represented as a vector, the regulator's parameters are easily applicable to multidimensional objects. A genetic algorithm is employed to ascertain the optimal tuning parameters of the neuro-fuzzy regulator, characterized by high convergence and the ability to identify global extrema. The effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy regulator lies in its capability to ensure quality control of dynamic objects amidst random perturbations and uncertain input data
