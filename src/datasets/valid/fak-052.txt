Artificial intelligence chatbots are increasingly prevalent in the tourism sector due to their affordability and efficiency. Yet, the impact of chatbots' emotional displays on service outcomes has been largely overlooked by scholars. Based on expectancy violations theory, this study examines how chatbots' emotional expressions influence customer satisfaction across three experiments focused on recommending tourist attractions. It was found that chatbots that express concern for customers can enhance satisfaction by minimizing expectancy violations. Specifically, factors such as the customer's goal orientation, the human-like appearance of the chatbotâ€™s avatars, and the nature of the customer-chatbot relationship can mitigate the adverse effects of emotional expressions on expectancy violations. These results contribute to the understanding of chatbots' emotional expressions and offer valuable guidance for their implementation in customer service within the tourism industry.
