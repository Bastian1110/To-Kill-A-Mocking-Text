In developing countries such as Nigeria, artificial intelligence (AI) research has the potential to drive rapid advancement in various aspects of development, including the economy and technology. However, it is crucial to understand the focus of Nigerian AI researchers and identify unexplored areas of research that could lead to unprecedented development. To address this need, we used natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical algorithms to investigate the main areas of interest of Nigerian AI researchers. We identified ten topics and used scientometric analyses to reveal key concepts, keyword co-occurrences, and authorship networks. Our study found that Covenant University was the most prolific institution, with 375 publications, followed by the Federal University of Technology with 135 publications and the University of Ibadan with 121 publications. Overall, our research provides valuable insights into the structure and progression of AI research in Nigeria and highlights areas for improvement.
