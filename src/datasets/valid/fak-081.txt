With the rise of the internet and rapid technological progress, people are overwhelmed by an abundance of information and choices, complicating the decision-making process. A Recommender System (RS) offers a viable way to assist users by predicting or suggesting product ratings. There are three primary types of RS based on the feedback they utilize, whether implicit or explicit: collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. While ratings are a typical form of feedback, other elements like product descriptions, reviews, and multimedia content such as images, videos, and audios are also crucial and can significantly enhance a traditional RS's effectiveness. These elements can dramatically influence the outcomes of an RS. Originally, RSs employed nearest neighbor and various other traditional machine learning techniques, but the advent of artificial intelligence and deep learning has shifted development towards using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This shift allows for better utilization of auxiliary data. This paper not only compares various CNN-based RSs but also thoroughly reviews how they incorporate different types of auxiliary information. It further explores the characteristics and statistics of data and auxiliary content across several accessible datasets. Additionally, the paper covers different evaluation metrics for RSs and presents several challenges and areas for future research that will interest scholars.
