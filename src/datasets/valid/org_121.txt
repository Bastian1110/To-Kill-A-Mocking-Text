Artificial intelligence is leading the technological future worldwide, and the intersection of artificial intelligence is increasing day by day in various fields. Throughout history, art has been influenced by political, economic conditions and religious beliefs, but recently technology has played an important and effective role in the art world, especially sculpture. Many opinions differ about accepting or rejecting the idea of the integration of digital technology with art, and it seems that many factors affect the extent to which society accepts or rejects the integration of technology with the arts, and sculpture, because of its special nature. People are used to seeing sculpture in a physical form, not a digital one. But the current situation has gone beyond whether the sculpture is traditional or digital; as the tremendous and rapid technological development has led to the entry of artificial intelligence technology into the world of art; here comes an important question: Does artificial intelligence technology threaten the survival of the designerâ€™s role in the future? The research will discuss some of the AI sculptures, the role and the future of the designer in the world of art in light of the huge technological revolution we are witnessing today and the current and future challenges in light of the integration of digital technology with sculpture.
