This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in developing computer vision techniques to analyze human emotional responses in video sequences during interactions with various visual media. The objective is to create effective software that can recognize emotions by using AI-driven algorithms and image analysis frameworks to capture and interpret facial expressions. The methodology includes capturing images of users to evaluate their emotional states and employing computer vision techniques rooted in psychological theories about emotions and their visible indicators. The research confirms that emotion detection is viable using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and through the creation and training of software tailored to recognize facial emotions. While the initial results show promising accuracy in emotion detection, enhancing the precision requires more extensive training with a broader array of images and the integration of advanced algorithms to differentiate between similar emotional expressions. The findings and discussions underscore the capabilities of AI and computer vision in recognizing emotions, shedding light on the nuances of software engineering, the necessity for ongoing algorithm training, and the dynamic field of emotion detection technology. Further advancements are needed to improve detection accuracy, especially in scenarios involving a wide variety of images and where distinguishing between nuanced expressions is crucial.
