The finance-level Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is going to become a novel media in the 6G-driven digital society. Inside the financial AIoT environment, large-scale crowd credit assessment with the guarantee of low latency has been a general demand. Facing limited computational resources, there is still a lack of effective computation offloading methods for this purpose to ensure low latency. In order to deal with such an issue, this article introduces edge computing mode and proposes a low-latency edge computation offloading scheme for trust evaluation in financial AIoT. With different elements involved in the assessment process being denoted via mathematical description, a multiobjective optimization problem with constraints is formulated. Then, the aforementioned optimization problem is solved by a specific search algorithm, so that optimal task offloading schemes can be found. To assess the performance of the proposal, some simulation experiments are conducted to verify the proposed task offloading method. And it can be reflected from numerical results that latency can be well reduced compared with baseline methods.
