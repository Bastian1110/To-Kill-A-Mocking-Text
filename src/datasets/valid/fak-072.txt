This paper examines the origins of technological disruptions in electrical systems and highlights key weaknesses in the protection and automation of these systems. It discusses the reduced reliability of relay protection following the shift from analog to digital protection methods. The article advocates for the incorporation of fuzzy logic in protective devices and the automation of electrical systems to accurately detect types of short circuits, based on the examples reviewed. It presents an analysis of prevalent damages and includes results from simulating an electric system with transformer coupling where all forms of asymmetric short circuits were initiated. This simulation helped establish the dynamics of changes in the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents for the forward, reverse, and zero sequences. Identification rules for asymmetric short circuits were formulated. An innovative algorithm employing fuzzy logic for the operation of protection and automation systems was also developed. This new algorithm aims to expedite the diagnosis of damage types and the activation of protective measures.
