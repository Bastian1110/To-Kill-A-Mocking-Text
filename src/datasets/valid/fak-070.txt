This study presents an experiential approach using an Artificial Life competitive game designed to simulate an artificial life environment, aimed at providing unstructured and informal teaching of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to students in computer science engineering programs. The game is set in a simulated Petri dish where two colonies of microorganisms, represented as software agents, engage in a survival struggle. Participants are tasked with implementing survival strategies for their agents, encompassing fighting strategies and basic reproduction rules to ensure their agents' survival in the artificial environment. The technical foundations of the competition, along with a detailed description of the artificial life model, are elucidated. The pedagogical insights gained from the contest development are discussed, highlighting the resulting learning experience that fostered student enthusiasm and facilitated the development of mental models related to AI algorithms.
