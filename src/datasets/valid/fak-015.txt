Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has become a premier, highly flexible, and effective method for analyzing materials. Utilizing thermochemical methods, IGC offers essential insights into the physicochemical properties of materials, including dispersive surface free energy, Gibbs surface energy components, and Guttamann Lewis acid-base parameters. This detailed review explores the historical development, instrumentation, and varied uses of IGC. It provides researchers and practitioners with crucial data on the selection and utilization of various models in IGC experimentation. IGC's applications cover a broad array of fields such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, minerals, surfactants, and nanotechnology. Additionally, IGC allows for the assessment of critical properties like sorption enthalpy and entropy, surface energy components (both dispersive and specific), co/adhesion work, glass transition temperatures, surface heterogeneity, miscibility, solubility parameters, and specific surface areas. These measurements are invaluable for understanding material properties and enhancing material design and optimization. The use of computer vision and image processing in conjunction with IGC has furthered our knowledge of the complex surface characteristics of materials, such as texture and roughness. The fusion of IGC with computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) is paving new paths for the study of chemical materials, offering promising new research directions. This document not only provides an exhaustive summary of IGC and its applications but also underscores the combined power of IGC with AI and computer vision. The insights and data presented will serve researchers, scientists, and professionals in the advanced materials sector, empowering them to employ IGC and AI for groundbreaking material innovation and development.
