In response to the challenges posed by inter-domain information fusion and data sparsity in collaborative filtering algorithms, this research introduces a novel approach called cross-domain information fusion matrix decomposition algorithm to enhance the precision of personalized recommendations in artificial intelligence recommendation systems. The study initiates by gathering Douban movie rating data and social network information. A Levenshtein distance detection technique is utilized to ensure data integrity by eliminating duplicate scores, while natural language processing (NLP) technology is employed to extract keywords and topic information from social texts. Furthermore, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are leveraged to transform user relationships into feature vectors, and a unique thermal coding methodology is applied to convert discrete user and movie information into binary matrices. To mitigate overfitting, the Ridge regularization method is introduced to gradually optimize potential feature vectors. Weighted average and feature connection techniques are then incorporated to amalgamate features from various domains. Additionally, the paper integrates the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm with merged user characteristics to generate personalized recommendation lists. In the experimental phase, the study performs cross-domain information fusion optimization on four prominent mathematical matrix decomposition algorithms, namely the alternating least squares method, non-negative matrix decomposition, singular value decomposition, and latent factor model (LFM), in comparison with the non-fused approach. The outcomes demonstrate a significant enhancement in score accuracy, with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) reduced by 12.8% and 13.2% respectively across the four algorithms. Moreover, at k = 10, the average F1 score reaches 0.97, and the ranking accuracy coverage of the LFM algorithm increases by 54.2%. Overall, the mathematical matrix decomposition algorithm combined with cross-domain information fusion exhibits clear advantages in terms of accuracy, prediction performance, recommendation diversity, and ranking quality, leading to an improvement in the accuracy and diversity of the recommendation system. By effectively tackling collaborative filtering challenges through the integration of diverse methodologies, it surpasses traditional models in recommendation accuracy and variety
