The remarkable abilities of living organisms stem from the embodiment of autonomy within their structures. Throughout various scales, organisms integrate cognitive and computational intelligence with physical intelligence, enabled by their body morphology, the multifunctionality of materials, and mechanical flexibility. Although the field of soft robotics has made strides in crafting bodies with physical intelligence, fully incorporating computational intelligence for information processing is still problematic. This issue has led to limitations in perception and control that affect the current construction of soft robots. Advancing towards true untethered autonomy will involve a unified approach in developing new materials, fabrication techniques, and control systems for soft robots. This paper introduces a new approach where tasks alone dictate the material and informational constraints in soft robot design. It suggests a task-first design paradigm that bypasses the traditional constraints of control strategies, facilitating the use of emergent properties of soft materials for task-specific agents. The solutionâ€™s effectiveness is also discussed with respect to its scale. Additionally, the paper highlights future research directions for achieving autonomy in soft robots, ranging from the size of elephant trunks to that of paramecia.
