Implementation of artificial intelligence tends to be portable, mobile and embeds in embedded computer system (EBD). EBD is a special-purpose computer with limited capacity in a small-form size. Deep learning (DL) had known as cutting edges for object recognition. With DL, object feature extraction analysis is omitted. DL requires large computing resources and capacity. Implement DL algorithm on EBD goal to achieves high detection accuracy and high-efficiency resources. Hence, be able to cope with intra-class variations, and image disturbances. By those challenges and limitations, this study reports the performance of EBD to recognize an object which has high variations in their class, through an optimal raw-input dataset. The raw-input dataset performed optimization process with a supervisor. Yield is the proper optimal input dataset in size. The performance results observed begin from training dataset until evaluation stage of DL. The comparison performs in efficiency resources, loss, validation-loss, timesteps, and detection accuracy by multiclass confusion matrix analysis. This study shows through this purpose method efficient resources are highly archived. Shorter timesteps ensure training stage is successful, and detection accuracy is perfectly archived. In addition, this study proves DL method archived great performances in classifying object that has identical structure.
