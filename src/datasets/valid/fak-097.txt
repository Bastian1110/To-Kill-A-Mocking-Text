Tailoring the difficulty level accurately is essential for maintaining player interest in a game. A popular method for enhancing the gaming experience is Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), which fine-tunes various game settings automatically based on the player's performance. This article synthesizes research on various strategies for modifying video game difficulty according to players' performance, emotional states, or personalities. It covers studies on DDA that utilize machine learning algorithms, player modeling techniques, and different data types to gauge player conditions, across various game genres and applications. The literature includes journal and conference articles up until September 2022. Results from these studies indicate that DDA significantly impacts player satisfaction, including factors like fun, flow, motivation, engagement, and depth of immersion. Notably, there has been a surge in interest in applying machine learning and player modeling methods to develop DDA systems. However, as gaming becomes increasingly prevalent across different fields, more research is essential to more accurately map out player preferences and optimize game settings effectively. Future research could probe deeper into the cognitive aspects of players such as visual attention, memory capacity, and reaction speeds to enhance understanding of player preferences.
