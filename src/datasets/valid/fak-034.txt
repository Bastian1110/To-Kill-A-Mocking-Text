Artificial intelligence represents a cutting-edge technology designed to emulate human cognition in machines, programmed to replicate human thought and actions. Autonomous vehicles operate independently, performing essential tasks with no human intervention. This advanced technology could lead to enhanced safety for passengers, reduced road congestion, optimal traffic flow, decreased fuel usage, lower emissions, and improved travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles are crucial in sectors such as industry, agriculture, transportation, and the military. Their operations are driven by sensor data and several AI systems. Artificial intelligence in these vehicles involves data gathering, route planning, and execution, necessitating certain machine learning methods that form a part of AI. However, these advancements raise significant privacy and security issues. This article will address the cybersecurity challenges faced when integrating AI into autonomous vehicles and discuss the evolving field of self-driving cars.
