The metaverse has emerged as an exciting and innovative paradigm for human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual collaboration. This study aims to fill a gap in the current literature by providing a thorough review of the metaverse, focusing on its human-centric aspects. We begin by synthesizing a definition of the metaverse based on existing literature and highlighting its key features. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive framework that covers the nature of the metaverse, its underlying infrastructure technologies, and the input/output technologies that enable multi-sensory HCI experiences. We also explore various applications of the metaverse across different domains. Each component of our framework is elaborated upon to provide a deeper understanding of the metaverse and assess the current state of relevant technologies. Through this extensive analysis, we identify major challenges and propose directions for future research and development. This review aims to provide clarity on the concept of the metaverse and the essential building blocks required for its realization, serving as a valuable resource for developers and researchers working in this field
