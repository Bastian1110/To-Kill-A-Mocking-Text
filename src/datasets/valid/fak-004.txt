Approach: This paper was developed through a narrative synthesis coupled with a systematic review of existing literature, drawing from a range of sources including books and scholarly articles from databases such as EBSCO, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Selection was limited to studies that offered a clear definition of artificial intelligence within educational contexts, published in English, and undergone peer review. The process involved five independent reviewers who evaluated the search results, conducted data extraction, and assessed the quality of the studies to compile and present these insights.
Findings: The integration of artificial intelligence in education is becoming commonplace. Its deployment is seen as a strategic element essential for the evolution of educational frameworks. Artificial intelligence also serves an emerging role as a digital aide, supporting educators and students by providing tailored access to extensive learning resources that align with individual needs and subject areas. Nevertheless, this technological progress comes with potential downsides, including issues related to safety, security, and privacy. Hence, artificial intelligence impacts the educational field in both beneficial and detrimental ways.
Summary: The influence of artificial intelligence in educational systems carries both advantages and disadvantages. It is essential to focus on artificial intelligence within educational strategies to address and fulfill the expectations and needs of educators and students. By doing so, there is a potential to significantly enhance academic outcomes.
Future Directions & Practical Applications: Further studies might involve qualitative methods like interviews or quantitative approaches such as surveys to deepen understanding and derive more detailed conclusions. These findings could inform strategies for school leaders, educators, and students, aimed at leveraging artificial intelligence to boost educational outcomes.
