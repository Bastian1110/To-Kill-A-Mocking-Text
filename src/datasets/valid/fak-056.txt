INTRODUCTION: The integration of Artificial Intelligence with neuroscience has significantly grown, especially in exploring brain mechanics and crafting treatments for brain-related ailments. Techniques like artificial neural networks and deep learning have shed light on how the brain processes information and functions. There's a burgeoning field of research exploring the impact of neural activities on personal well-being.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to scrutinize the nexus between neuroscience and individual happiness, drawing on recent developments in Artificial Intelligence. 
METHODS: This research involved a bibliometric review of literature sourced from the Scopus database covering the period from 2013 to 2023, utilizing VOSviewer for data analysis.
RESULTS: The review compiled 603 papers, with the highest contributions coming from the United States (184 papers), the United Kingdom (74 papers), and China (73 papers). Analysis of keyword co-occurrence resulted in three primary clusters: The first, colored red, focuses on how Artificial Intelligence predicts happiness; the second, green, examines AI's utility in neuroscience; and the third, blue, considers the role of neuroscience in psychology.
CONCLUSION: Advances in neuroscience have profoundly enhanced our understanding of cognitive processes like emotion and consciousness. The field of neuroscience is increasingly adopting a happiness-centric approach to research, leveraging Artificial Intelligence to forge new understandings of human well-being.
