This paper explores the complex field of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control within nonholonomic multirobot systems, which are affected by infinite actuator faults and range limitations. To tackle these challenges, the utility of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) is harnessed, along with adaptive techniques to estimate unknown nonlinearities and uncertainties in robot dynamics. The issues of avoiding collisions and ensuring connectivity remain due to distance and visual field constraints. In response, we implement a universal barrier function and a prescribed performance approach to effectively manage these range restrictions. Additionally, to minimize the frequency of controller activations and mitigate the impacts of endless actuator faults, robots synchronize with their leader upon experiencing actuator failures, utilizing fewer network communications while still following the leader's set path seamlessly. Employing dynamic surface technology, we introduce a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy, ensuring that all signals remain semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). We validate the practical applicability of our ETFT control approach in managing nonholonomic multirobot systems.
