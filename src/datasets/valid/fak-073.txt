The assessment of usability for an m-commerce mobile application through fuzzy logic is a technique that evaluates how a mobile app meets user expectations. It hinges on the principles of fuzzy logic to evaluate user satisfaction by analyzing expectations and preferences. Fuzzy logic is typically the preferred method for such assessments. This approach evaluates an m-commerce app's user experience by considering what users need, prefer, and anticipate. Usability expectations also encompass the ease with which users can navigate and interact with the app, how well the app aligns with user expectations, and the general satisfaction users derive from the app. This evaluation process pinpoints potential improvements, thus guiding developers to enhance the user experience. This paper outlines a framework for creating a usability metric that utilizes fuzzy logic to gauge the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application. This framework, rooted in the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) methodology, aims to systematically develop metrics that can qualitatively assess mobile applications. Developed and validated within an m-commerce environment, this framework offers a precise set of criteria to evaluate m-commerce apps against established standards. The insights gained from these assessments can help refine m-commerce applications, ensuring an optimal user experience.
