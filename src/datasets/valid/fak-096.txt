Here's a transformed version that maintains the original message while altering the wording and structure. In numerous scientific fields such as biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology, tracking animal behavior accurately throughout experiments is crucial, especially when markerless methods are used. Extracting precise movements from constantly changing backgrounds has remained a challenge. Recently, we introduced an open-source toolkit that utilizes a sophisticated algorithm designed to estimate human poses. This toolkit enables users to train a deep neural network to monitor user-specified attributes with precision that competes with manual labeling efforts. The latest update to this Python module includes several enhancements such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), increased efficiency, and network optimization through active learning. These improvements facilitate users in establishing a customized and reproducible analysis pipeline that leverages a graphical processing unit (GPU).
