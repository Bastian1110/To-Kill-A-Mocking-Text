The evolution of autonomous vehicles is heading towards a synthesis of human-focused design principles and sophisticated artificial intelligence technologies. Future autonomous vehicles are envisioned to not just ferry passengers but to interact with them, adapting to their needs to enhance the comfort, efficiency, and enjoyment of their travels. In our study, we introduce an innovative framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the decision-making abilities of autonomous vehicles. This framework integrates the natural language understanding and contextual awareness of LLMs with their application in various autonomous vehicle systems, thereby enabling a comprehensive integration of advanced linguistic and cognitive functions into the vehicles. Our proposed model could dramatically transform autonomous vehicle functionalities by providing personalized services, the ability for continuous adaptation through learning, and clear, accountable decision-making processes. These advancements could significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems.
