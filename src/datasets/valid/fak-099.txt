As educational paradigms evolve alongside technology, educators are recognizing that games can serve as more than just entertainment for students. Games can be powerful teaching tools that enhance educational outcomes. In light of the vast array of resources available online, there is a need for better quality recommendations. A novel personalized recommendation system for educational video game resources has been developed, utilizing knowledge graphs. This system begins by alternately extracting features from both the user side and the item side. It then incorporates a hidden Markov model on top of the dual-end neighbor algorithm to better reflect the temporal dynamics of user interactions. This enhanced model accounts for both the long-term and short-term preferences of users, uncovering their latent preferences. Experimental results show that the model achieves a hit rate of 0.7989 and a normalized cumulative gain of 0.6045. It satisfies over 89% of its users and operates with a swift response time of 0.2863 seconds. This model offers an effective and high-quality means of recommending educational video games, thus improving the online user experience.
