The increasing population also means a larger consumer base, leading to higher demand and resource utilization to meet the needs of the growing number of consumers. Just as technology is utilized to address various challenges, why not apply it to enhance the supermarket experience? The concept aims to create a more convenient and advanced supermarket experience, eliminating the need for cashiers and long queues, allowing customers to shop hassle-free. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate supermarket operations for improved efficiency. Customers simply need to enter the supermarket after scanning their unique QR code via a dedicated app. This action registers their presence in the store. Shopping carts and baskets are equipped with sensors that detect when products are added or removed. Shelves are equipped with pressure sensors to detect product pickups, and they only open when authorized by the shopping cart. At the checkout counter, customers swipe their card again, and payment is automatically deducted from their account based on their purchases, with a receipt provided. We aim to offer this technology to various supermarket chains nationally and internationally, aiding them in implementing it with a reasonable one-time investment.
