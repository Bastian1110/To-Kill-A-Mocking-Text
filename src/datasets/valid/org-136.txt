In the context of smart cities, ensuring road safety is crucial due to increasing urbanization and the interconnected nature of contemporary urban environments. Leveraging innovative technologies is essential to mitigate risks and create safer communities. Thus, there is a compelling imperative to develop advanced solutions to enhance road safety within smart city frameworks. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive vehicle safety framework tailored specifically for smart cities in the realm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). This framework seamlessly integrates a variety of sensors, including eye blink, ultrasonic, and alcohol sensors, to bolster road safety. The utilization of eye blink sensor serves to promptly detect potential hazards, alerting drivers through audible cues and thereby enhancing safety on smart city roads. Moreover, ultrasonic sensors provide real time information about surrounding vehicle speeds, thereby facilitating smoother traffic flow. To address concerns related to alcohol consumption and its potential impact on road safety, our framework incorporates a specialized sensor that effectively monitors the driver’s alcohol levels. In instances of high alcohol content, the system utilizes GPS and GSM technology to automatically adjust the vehicle’s speed while simultaneously notifying pertinent authorities for prompt intervention. Additionally, our proposed system optimizes inter-vehicle communication in smart cities by leveraging Li-Fi technology, enabling faster and more efficient data transmission via visible light communication (VLC). The integration of Li-Fi enhances connectivity among connected vehicles, contributing to a more cohesive and intelligent urban transportation network. Through the structured integration of AIoT technologies, our framework lays a robust foundation for a safer, smarter, and more sustainable future in smart city transportation. It offers significant advancements in road safety and establishes the groundwork for further enhancement in intelligent urban transportation networks.
