Technological advances in tools such as artificial intelligence have made it easier for architects, planners, interior designers and urban designers to visualize their designs easily and save time. Today, AI (Artificial Intelligence) is integrated into many different professions, and the design sector is no exception. Also, new design technologies, for example, OpenAI, ChatGPT, Dall-E 2, and Mid Journey, quickly dissolve the lines between what humans do at work and what machines and algorithms do. Despite the fact that design is a highly creative discipline that calls for a special blend of technical expertise, aesthetic judgment, and user empathy, AI systems are currently unable to fully recreate these skills. They only provide output in accordance with system input. They are unable to independently innovate new things. And indeed, we discovered that AI fundamentally alters the practice of design. Traditional problem-solving tasks performed by designers are increasingly computerized into unrestricted volume and speed learning loops. This situation raises the question of whether artificial intelligence will replace the job of designers in the future. This essay would attempt to give an explanation of two factors, first, how AI technology would mitigate designersâ€™ duties, and second, the reasons why it would not be able to replace designers and architects in the near future. The article seeks to do a discourse, summarizing the studies on the effects of AI on the professional activity of designers and projecting where future designers will stand in their respective fields. Furthermore, this paper discusses the implications of artificial intelligence on the profession of designers, such as job displacement, job redefinition, and changes in the skill set required to be successful in the profession. Finally, the outcome of the essay is to understand the revolutionary impact of AI tools in design sectors in the future.
