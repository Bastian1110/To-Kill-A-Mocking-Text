The prevalence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational contexts has sparked an increase in scholarly publications within this domain. Despite this growth, there have been no extensive reviews analyzing the breadth of the field comprehensively. This study addresses this oversight by reviewing 4,519 articles published from 2000 to 2019, employing topic-based bibliometric analysis to explore the evolution and core themes within the field of AI in education (AIEd). The findings indicate a growing academic interest in leveraging AI for educational ends. Key areas of research have been identified as follows: specialized intelligent tutoring systems; natural language processing applications for language learning; the use of educational robots in teaching AI; the application of educational data mining for predicting student performance; discourse analysis techniques in computer-supported cooperative learning environments; neural networks for evaluating teaching methods; affective computing to assess student emotions; and personalized learning through recommender systems. Additionally, the paper highlights several challenges and suggests potential future research directions in AIEd.
