The field of empathy computing is an innovative area that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to forecast, detect, replicate, and produce human empathy. This discipline relies on psychological research for its concepts, measurement techniques, neural underpinnings, and practical uses of empathy, and utilizes advanced computational methods to analyze and mimic empathetic behaviors. This paper provides a critical analysis of the existing studies in empathy computing and explores its prospective paths from a psychological viewpoint, aiming to support foundational studies and their real-world implementations.Present studies in empathy computing are organized into four distinct themes, each defined by its specific goals and methodologies. Firstly, the primary objective of empathy computing is to understand and analyze empathy via computational means. This effort is split into two sub-categories: (1) assessment of individual empathy, which examines personal empathetic characteristics, and (2) classification of empathetic content in text, focusing on textual rather than personal attributes. Secondly, the field also aims to simulate and manifest empathy through technology, involving (3) the creation of systems that offer empathetic responses and (4) the production of systems that generate empathetic dialogues autonomously, moving beyond simple rule-based interactions. These four avenues of research, while distinct, support and enhance one another. Furthermore, future advancements are anticipated to include enhancements in empathetic capabilities of machines using technologies such as brain-computer interfaces.Although still nascent, empathy computing research has demonstrated its potential for novel applications in various sectors including mental health, education, business services, and public administration. These areas, rich in interpersonal exchanges, are poised to become central to human-computer interactions and principal contexts for applying empathy computing. For instance, in mental health, it can improve automatic assessment and reinforcement of therapistsâ€™ empathetic skills and provide AI-powered empathetic assistance. In education, empathetic AI tutors could enhance learning experiences; in business, it can create personalized customer interactions to boost loyalty and satisfaction; and in public management, it can produce empathetic communications to mitigate hostile speech and assist policymakers in empathetically addressing public concerns, thus building governmental trust.This expansive view of empathy computing not only automates and scales empathy assessment and analysis but also broadens empathy's theoretical framework from interpersonal to human-AI interactions, posing new questions about empathy's universal qualities and its adaptive potential. The promise of empathy computing lies in its ability to underpin a comprehensive theory of empathy that includes various types of relationships. It is pivotal for a deeper, holistic understanding of empathy and its promotion in a technologically advanced society.Future research directions should include the creation of cohesive theoretical models for empathy computing, the compilation of robust psychological and behavioral empathy datasets, and the continual refinement of the field through human-centric research. The involvement of psychologists is crucial in leading and fine-tuning this research and application, ensuring that AI is taught to emulate empathy both effectively and ethically, thereby enhancing human wellbeing in an increasingly intelligent world.
